EXPECTATIONS AND COMMITMENT
Congratulations on your selection to be a part of a New Restaurant Opening (NRO) at Chipotle. This is
one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences a Chipotle employee can be a part of. You will play
a pivotal role in ensuring that the management team and crew at this brand-new Chipotle makes the
line the moment of truth from day one. This is a unique opportunity to establish a world-class training
culture and ensure the new team learns how to teach and taste Chipotle. During the next several
days, you will be expected to provide a thorough, engaging, and organized training experience for
your new team. In order to do that, it is helpful to revisit the Certified Trainer Top 5, which every
Chipotle manager should carry with them throughout their career:
The Role of the Certified Trainer
1. Train new hires to deliver 100% of the standards 100% of the time
2. Cross-train your team to deliver 100% of the standards 100% of the time
3. Uphold Chipotle’s standards and procedures
4. Use the training materials to ensure consistency
5. Provide honest and timely feedback often and sincerely
While you are training your team, which will be a mix of pre-trained and brand-new crew, it will be
especially important to keep these in mind. Brand new crew will need a lot of direction and guidance
with very thorough introductions. Others may have bad habits that we need to coach very closely.
Some may just need to build their confidence, and the rest will blow you away by how quickly they
become rock stars! No matter what, using our tools will ensure a consistent and clear message from
you to your trainees, so they know exactly how to deliver the Chipotle standard.
Here are some other tips to make sure you’re well-prepared:
• Read through this guide to understand the structure of each day. Reach out to your NRO
Strategist/Manager with any questions.
• Have a deep knowledge of and prepare to fully utilize all training materials. Review the
Trainer’s Guide in depth for any stations or tasks which you will be teaching.
• Stay organized, disciplined, and keep your eye on the clock.
• Be relentless in upholding the standard- demand perfection and settle for excellence. We
commonly make the mistake of moving the target based on an employee’s abilities: the
standard remains the standard regardless.
• Be patient and be motivating. Guide them to the standard with clear and direct feedback, the
perfect learning state is “relaxed alertness” – calm and engaged.
• Avoid the word “I”. It’s not about how I like to cut an onion- it’s about how “we” cut onions at
Chipotle. There’s only one best way – our way, the Chipotle way.
COMMITMENT
I commit to the above expectations and to fully apply my talents and effort to my team and everyone
involved in the NRO process, to be the best trainer I can be, teach the “one best way” and aim for
100% of the standard, 100% of the time.

LINE DEMO SCRIPTS: BURRITO
1. Greet the customer with ‘‘Hi, welcome to Chipotle!’’ or ‘‘hello!’’ then ask, ‘‘what can I get
started for you?’’
2. If a burrito is ordered, place a burrito-sized tortilla in the press. While the tortilla is
heating, pull out a piece of burrito-sized foil and place it shiny side down on the line,
smoothing out the corners with both hands, with the crease running parallel to the
line
3. As soon as the press rises slightly and/or steam escapes (approximately 8 seconds),
remove the tortilla and place it centered on the foil, the side with the toast points
down on the foil
a. Do not apply pressure to the press while heating the tortilla; this will result in a crispy
tortilla
b. Keep the edge of the tortilla and foil along the edges of the pans; this is called ‘‘riding
the rail’’
c. Keep your non-dominant hand behind the tortilla; this is called the ‘‘backstop’’
d. While adding ingredients, ensure to not touch the utensils to the tortilla/other
ingredients
4. Ask as many of the following questions as you can while the tortilla is heating up, repeating
the requests back to the guest:
5. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any white or brown rice?’’
a. Place one rounded spoonful of the selected rice in the center of the tortilla
6. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any black or pinto beans?’’
a. Get a rounded spoonful of beans, tap the spoon twice to shake off excess
broth, then place directly on top of the rice
b. If fajitas are requested, place a pinch of fajitas on top of the other ingredients
7. Ask ‘‘What kind of meat would you like?’’
a. Place one full scoop or tong-full of the selected meat directly on top of the other
ingredients
8. Ask ‘‘Would you like to add queso to your entrée or on the side?’’
a. If on the entrée, pull one ladle-full horizontally across the other ingredients and
send a yellow table tent down the line in front of the entree
b. If on the side, ask ‘‘Regular or large?’’ and fill the proper container per request
67

Page 68:
9. Ask, ‘‘What kind of salsa would you like?’’
a. If Mild or Medium Corn, get a rounded spoonful, tap the spoon twice to shake off
excess liquid and place directly on top of the other ingredients
b. If Medium Green or Hot, get a ladle full holding the ladle ‘‘like a pencil’’ and
pull horizontally across the other ingredients
c. If multiple salsas are requested, split the portions accordingly- a half scoop of each for
2 salsas, and so on
10. Ask, ‘‘Any sour cream or cheese?’
a. If sour cream, get a spoonful, tap the spoon twice to remove excess and
‘‘ribbon’’ horizontally across the other ingredients
b. Pro-Tip: ‘‘air tap’’ the spoon to avoid dirtying the pan edge
c. If cheese, sprinkle a three-finger pinch over the other ingredients
11. Ask, ‘‘Would you like to add guac?’’
a. If guac, tap the spoon twice and ‘‘double-phwap’’ the guacamole in a line
behind the rest of the ingredients closest to you
12. Ask, ‘‘Did we make this perfectly for you?’’
a. If ‘‘Yes,’’ tightly roll the burrito, label properly and pass to the Expo/Cash
68

Page 69:
ROLLING A BURRITO
1. Lift the side of the tortilla closest to you with your dominant hand while lifting the side
closest to the guest with your non-dominant hand, forming a ‘‘giant taco’’.
2. Use your dominant hand to slide the tortilla over the food in the middle as you release
your front hand, forming a wide, loose grip around the food. Do not squeeze, which will
cause the burrito to tear on the ends. If done properly, you can release your hand and
the burrito will stay in place.
3. Using your non-dominant hand, tuck your fingers under the tortilla, pinch with your
thumb and fold up to make a two- or three-finger fold on the side of the burrito.
4. Holding your first fold in place, release your dominant hand and repeat the fold on
the opposite end of the burrito. Leave a one- to two-inch gap between the two folds.
Make the two folds point like an arrow toward your guest; this prevents ‘‘dog ears’’ on
the end of the tortilla once the burrito is rolled.
5. Roll the burrito forward, tightening with one hand at a time, marching left hand then right
hand.
6. Once the burrito is wrapped, place a thumb on the front of the foil and slide the burrito
back, smoothing the foil and tightening the burrito.
7. Roll the burrito forward in the foil, wrapping until the tortilla is no longer visible.
8. Tuck the foil around each end of the burrito in a cupping motion.
9. Repeat the folds on each end just as you did with the tortilla.
10. Roll the burrito forward, tightening with one hand at a time.
11. Once complete, label the burrito and pass it to Expo.
69

Page 70:
BOWL
1. Greet the customer with ‘‘Hi, welcome to Chipotle!’’ or ‘‘hello!’’ then ask, ‘‘what can I get
started for you?’’
2. If a bowl is ordered, ask ‘‘For here or to go?’’
a. If ‘‘for here’’, grab a bowl
b. If ‘‘to go’’, grab a bowl and a lid, and place the lid underneath the bowl
3. We do not need to ‘‘ride the rail’’ with a bowl; instead, we can take the bowl
directly to the ingredients requested. This is called ‘‘flying to the food’’
4. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any white or brown rice?’’
a. Place one rounded spoonful of the selected rice in the center of the bowl
5. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any black or pinto beans?’’
a. Get a rounded spoonful of beans, tap the spoon twice to shake off excess broth,
then place directly on top of the rice
b. If fajitas are requested, place a pinch of fajitas on top of the other ingredients
6. Ask ‘‘What kind of meat would you like?’’
a. Place one full scoop or tong-full of the selected meat directly on top of the other
ingredients
7. Ask ‘‘Would you like to add queso to your entrée or on the side?’’
a. If on the entrée, pull one ladle-full horizontally across the other ingredients and
send a yellow table tent down the line in front of the entree
b. If on the side, ask ‘‘Regular or large?’’ and fill the proper container per request
8. Ask, ‘‘What kind of salsa would you like?’’

9. Ask, ‘‘Any sour cream or cheese?’
a. If sour cream, get a spoonful, tap the spoon twice to remove excess and
‘‘ribbon’’ horizontally across the other ingredients
b. Pro-Tip: ‘‘air tap’’ the spoon to avoid dirtying the pan edge
c. If cheese, sprinkle a three-finger pinch over the other ingredients

a. Tap the spoon twice and ‘‘double-phwap’’ the guacamole in a line on

11. Ask, ‘‘Did we make this perfectly for you?’’
a. If ‘‘Yes,’’ label properly according to the ‘‘How to Label Entrees’’
Recipe Card and pass to the Expo/Cash
b. If to go, place the lid on top of the bowl and secure to the bowl base using a
pinch all the way around the edge. Do not run your fingers along the edge as
this does not create a secure seal.
71

Page 72:
SALAD
1. Greet the customer with ‘‘Hi, welcome to Chipotle!’’ or ‘‘hello!’’ then ask, ‘‘what can I get
started for you?’’
2. If a salad is ordered, ask ‘‘For here or to go?’’
a. If ‘‘for here’’, grab a bowl
b. If ‘‘to go’’, grab a bowl and a lid, and place the lid underneath the bowl
3. Place a tong full of salad lettuce in the bottom of the bowl
4. Grab one Chipotle Honey Vinaigrette and bring it down the line in front of the salad
a. We do not need to ‘‘ride the rail’’ with a salad; instead, we can take the
salad directly to the ingredients requested. This is called ‘‘flying to the
food’’
5. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any black or pinto beans?’’
a. With salads, the lettuce is meant to replace the rice. If they would still
like rice, remember to customize with a smile
b. Get a rounded spoonful of beans, tap the spoon twice to shake off excess
