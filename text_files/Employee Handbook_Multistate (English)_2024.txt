Chief
 
Human
 
Resources
 
Officer
We
 
are
 
SO
 
excited
 
that
 
you've
 
decided
 
to
 
join
 
our
 
Family!
At
 
Chipotle,
 
our
 
Purpose
 
is
 
To
 
Cultivate
 
a
 
Better World.
 
We
 
apply
 
a
 
laser-like
 
focus
 
to
 
creating
 
a high-performing
 
team
 
of innovators who
 
are
 
committed
 
to
 
our
 
values
 
and
 
share
 
a
 
passion
 
for collaborating and
 
changing food
 
culture.
 
We're
 
truly
 
proud
 
of
 
our
 
strong
 
relationships with
 
our team 
members,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
our industry-leading
 
reputation in
 
the marketplace. We're
 
dedicated to
 
providing 
excellent
 
working
 
conditions,
 
competitive wages,
 
open
 
communication,
 
dynamic
 
employee involvement opportunities and
 
a
 
robust suite
 
of benefits.
 
Our reputation is
 
a
 
direct
 
reflection
 
of
 
your talent,
 
commitment,
 
and
 
dedication
 
to
 
bringing
 
your full
 
self
 
to work.
 
At
 
Chipotle,
 
your
 
voice
 
matters, so
 
when
 
you
 
have
 
ideas
 
about
 
improving
 
our
 
business
 
(for
 
example
 
guest
 
experience,
 
safety, collaboration,
 
etc.), we're all ears!
Our dedication to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) is also foundational
 
and unyielding. Our goal is to
 
foster
 
a culture
 
that values
 
and champions
 
our
 
diversity, while leveraging
 
the individual
 
talents of all team members to grow our business and Cultivate a Better
 
World.
We
 
are
 
Real People who are
 
passionate about the
 
Real Food we
 
create.
 
Our purpose is
 
to Cultivate a Better
 
World, and our values guide us in
 
everything
 
we do -
 
our values keep us real. We foster a culture that values and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business. As you
 
review this Handbook, please keep in mind that while we adhere to our policies, we are driven by our values.
THE
 
LINE
 
IS
 
THE
 
MOMENT
 
OF
 
TRUTH
When
 
our
 
guests
 
win,
 
so
 
do
 
we.
 
Everything we
 
do
 
starts
 
with
 
our
 
restaurants.
 
Serving
 
great
 
food, with
 
great
 
service
 
in
 
a
 
safe,
 
quick,
 
clean,
 
and happy environment is
 
always
 
priority one.
TEACH
 
AND
 
TASTE
 
CHIPOTLE
Take pride in
 
making the Chipotle experience exceptional. Take the
 
time to learn it
 
well, teach it right, and
 
hold others to
 
the same standard.
AUTHENTICITY
 
LIVES
 
HERE
Our
 
food
 
is
 
real
 
and
 
so
 
are
 
we.
 
Be
 
your full
 
self
 
and
 
make
 
a
 
difference.
THE
 
MOVEMENT
 
IS
 
REAL
Stand
 
up
 
for
 
what's
 
important,
 
even when
 
it's
 
hard.
 
We
 
source
 
better ingredients,
 
hire
 
better
 
people and
 
work
 
hard
 
to change the world.
 
Talk
 
about what
 
makes
 
you proud,
 
so
 
we
 
can
 
do more
 
of it.
This Handbook
 
is designed
 
to
 
tell you about
 
Chipotle
 
and its
 
subsidiaries
 
(collectively, "Chipotle"
 
or the "Company")
 
and provide answers to
 
many
 
of
 
your
 
questions
 
regarding
 
your
 
employment
 
with us.
The
 
contents
 
of
 
this
 
Handbook
 
are
 
only
 
a
 
summary of the
 
employee
 
benefits,
 
practices,
 
and
 
policies 
in
 
effect at the
 
time
 
of publication. Chipotle retains the right to
 
add,
 
modify,
 
or delete policies, benefits,
 
wages,
 
and
 
all
 
other
 
working
 
conditions
 
as
 
it
 
deems
 
appropriate
 
without
 
obtaining
 
another person's
 
consent or
 
agreement.
 
Therefore,
 
other than
 
the
 
at-will
 
agreement
 
contained
 
in
 
the Employee
 
Acknowledgment
 
and
 
Agreement
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
this
 
Handbook,
 
this
 
Handbook
 
should
 
not be construed as
 
creating any
 
kind of "employment
 
contract."
As provided in the Employee
 
Acknowledgment and
 
Agreement,
 
employment
 
at Chipotle is at-will and may be terminated
 
by either
 
you or Chipotle, with or without cause or prior notice. This Handbook supersedes any and all prior Handbooks, written documents or oral representations that contradict
 
the at-will nature of your
 
employment.
 
Your status as an "at-will" employee may not
 
be changed
 
except
 
in writing signed by
 
the Chief
 
Executive Officer
 
("CEO")
 
of Chipotle.
We encourage you to discuss any questions or concerns regarding this Handbook or any work­ related
 
issues with us.
 
We
 
cannot address any of your questions or concerns unless we
 
know about 
them.
If you have a problem, please speak with your immediate manager as soon as possible. They are responsible for
 
what takes place in your immediate work area and may be in the best position to help 
you.
If
 
you
 
prefer
 
not
 
to
 
speak
 
with your
 
immediate
 
manager,
 
or
 
if
 
you
 
feel
 
your
 
immediate
 
manager cannot or has not
 
satisfactorily resolved the issue, contact your HR Business Partner if you are in the Restaurant Support Center ("RSC") or the Respectful Workplace Hotline
 
("RWH") Team if you
 
are
 
in
 
a restaurant. You can also make an anonymous complaint by calling the Chipotle hotline at
 
1-866-755- 4449
 
or visiting
 
www.chipotleconfidential.com
. You are encouraged
 
to
 
utilize this procedure
 
without fear of retaliation.
If you have a complaint
 
of harassment or discrimination,
 
or you
 
require a reasonable accommodation, please refer to the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, the Policy Against Unlawful Harassment, Discrimination,
 
and Retaliation, or the Reasonable Accommodations Policies in this Handbook.
Chipotle takes all employee concerns and problems seriously. We will work to address your concern and/or resolve your problem as soon as possible. You are encouraged to bring concerns to our attention using any of
 
the
 
methods
 
described above

LACTATION
 
ACCOMMODATIONS
Chipotle strives to provide a supportive work environment
 
to enable all nursing employees to express milk during working hours in accordance with applicable law.
Lactation
 
Break.
 
Chipotle will provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate
 
an employee's
 
desire
 
to
 
express
 
breast
 
milk
 
for
 
the
 
employee's
 
child, for
 
up
 
to
 
one (1)
 
year
 
of
 
age, except
 
where state or
 
local law requires
 
a more extended
 
period.
 
If
 
possible, the
 
employee
 
should take
 
their
 
lactation
 
breaks
 
during
 
rest
 
breaks
 
and/or
 
meal
 
periods
 
already
 
provided. Hourly employees
 
should
 
clock
 
out
 
for
 
additional
 
lactation breaks that
 
do not run
 
concurrently
 
with normally scheduled
 
meal and/or
 
rest periods.
 
Break times
 
will only be paid where required by law.
Lactation
 
Location.
 
Chipotle
 
will
 
provide
 
a
 
lactation
 
location
 
(the
 
"Lactation
 
Location"),
 
other
 
than a bathroom, in close proximity
 
to the employee's
 
work area that is shielded
 
from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public while the employee is expressing milk. The Lactation Location may be the
 
place
 
where
 
the
 
employee
 
normally
 
works if it
 
otherwise meets
 
the requirements of this policy.
Requests for Lactation
 
Accommodation.
 
Employees have a right to request lactation accommodation,
 
which includes lactation breaks and a Lactation Location as discussed above.
 
To request
 
lactation
 
accommodation, obtain
 
a
 
Lactation
 
Accommodation
 
Request
 
Form
 
from
 
either your manager
 
or Chiplinks and submit
 
the completed form to both your manager
 
and 
benefits@chipotle.com
.
 
We will promptly respond to a request
 
for
 
lactation accommodation
 
and
 
will engage in an interactive process to
 
determine the appropriate lactation break periods and Lactation 
Location.
Retaliation Prohibited.
 
Chipotle has a zero-tolerance
 
policy against retaliation for any reason. Retaliation against an employee for exercising any rights under this policy or applicable law is 
prohibited.
Conflict with Applicable Law.
 
If any portion of this policy conflicts with any applicable provision of federal, state, or local law, then such provision of law shall control, and the conflicting portion of the policy will be void.

Chipotle will provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees
 
for known limitations related to
 
the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions of a qualified employee. If you require an accommodation
 
to
 
perform
 
the essential
 
functions
 
of
 
your
 
job
 
for
 
known
 
limitations
related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, please notify your manager
 
or HR Business Partner if you are
 
in
 
the RSC,
 
or the RWH
 
Team if you
 
are
 
in the restaurants
at
 
respectful@chipotle.com
.
 
Once we are aware of
 
the
 
need for
 
an accommodation,
 
we will engage in an interactive process to identify possible accommodations.
If Chipotle determines that all other reasonable accommodations create an undue hardship for the Company
 
and/or
 
pose a direct
 
threat
 
to
 
the health or safety
 
of
 
others in the
 
workplace and/or
 
to
 
the individual, Chipotle may require you to take a leave of absence, subject to the provision of medical documentation
 
of your
 
need. If you
 
do not
 
have available leave or
 
do
 
not
 
qualify for any state or federal protected leaves, Chipotle will provide a leave of absence to the extent leave is otherwise provided to eligible employees.
If you believe that you
 
have been treated in a manner
 
not
 
in accordance
 
with these policies, please notify Chipotle immediately
 
by speaking to
 
your
 
HR Business Partner if
 
you are in the
 
RSC, or
 
the RWH
 
Team if you
 
are
 
in the restaurants at 
respectful@chipotle.com
.
 
You
 
are
 
encouraged to utilize
 
this procedure without fear of retaliation.

AGAINST
 
UNLAWFUL
 
HARASSMENT,
 
DISCRIMINATION,
 
AND

Chipotle
 
is
 
committed to
 
providing
 
a
 
work
 
environment that

any
 
other category protected by
 
applicable federal,
 
state,
 
or local law.
Chipotle's policy against unlawful harassment, discrimination,
 
and retaliation applies to all employees, including managers.
 
It
 
also applies to
 
all guests, vendors, and independent
 
contractors, as well as to all interns and volunteers (all of whom are designated
 
for
 
the terms of this policy as "Third Parties"). Chipotle prohibits managers and employees from harassing subordinates or co-workers, as well as Third
 
Parties.
 
Any
 
such
 
harassment
 
will
 
subject
 
an
 
employee
 
to
 
disciplinary
 
action,
 
up to
 
and including immediate termination. Chipotle also prohibits Third Parties from harassing our employees, interns, and volunteers.

about
 
it.
 
Therefore,
 
it is
 
your
 
responsibility
 
to
 
bring
 
your concerns
 
and/or
 
problems
 
to
 
our
 
attention
 
so
 
we
 
can
 
take
 
appropriate
 
steps
 
to
 
address
 
the
 
situation. Chipotle
 
takes
 
all
 
complaints
 
of
 
unlawful
 
harassment
 
seriously
 
and
 
will
 
not
 
penalize
 
you
 
or
 
retaliate against you in
 
any
 
way for reporting
 
a
 
harassment problem in
 
good
 
faith.
If you are a manager, and you receive any complaint of harassment, discrimination,
 
or retaliation, you must promptly report such complaint to your HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, or the RWH Team if you
 
are
 
in
 
a
 
restaurant.
 
Failure
 
to promptly escalate or report such
 
complaints may
 
result in disciplinary
 
action, up to and including
 
termination.
 
All
 
complaints
 
of
 
unlawful
 
harassment which are reported to management
 
will be investigated as promptly as possible by an impartial and qualified
 
person, and
 
upon
 
conclusion
 
of
 
such
 
investigation,
 
appropriate
 
corrective
 
action
 
will
 
be taken where warranted. Chipotle expects employees to cooperate with internal investigations
 
and the internal
 
complaint
 
process.
 
This
 
expectation
 
does
 
not
 
apply
 
to
 
investigations related
 
to
 
proceedings by the National
 
Labor
 
Relations Board and is not
 
intended to
 
conflict
 
with or
 
limit employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act, including the rights to discuss wages, hours, and any other working
 
conditions,
 
and the
 
rights to
 
keep
 
such discussions
 
and activities
 
confidential.
 
All complaints of
 
unlawful
 
harassment
 
reported
 
to management
 
will be treated as confidentially as possible, consistent
 
with Chipotle's need to conduct
 
an adequate investigation.
Violation of this policy 
will 
subject an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination. 
Moreover, any manager
 
who allows or ignores potential violations of this policy
 
will be subject
 
to
 
appropriate
 
disciplinary
 
action, up to
 
and including
 
termination.
This policy should not
 
be interpreted
 
as and
 
will not
 
be applied to
 
restrict
 
any activity
 
that is protected under
 
the National Labor

PRACTICES
Management retains the right to reassign employees to a different shift where it is
 
necessary for
 
the efficient operation of Chipotle.
Chipotle may periodically schedule overtime
 
work to meet guest needs. We will attempt
 
to give as much advance notice as possible,
 
or as
 
required by local laws,
 
and we
 
expect that all employees who are scheduled
 
to
 
work
 
overtime
 
will be at
 
work. Otherwise, all overtime
 
work
 
must
 
be pre-approved by
 
your
 
manager.
 
Working
 
overtime
 
without
 
your

PAID
 
VACATION
Chipotle provides paid vacation
 
to
 
eligible employees
 
so that you
 
are better
 
able to
 
perform your
 
job when you return. For
 
this reason, we expect
 
you to
 
use your
 
vacation
 
time and do not
 
permit pay in lieu of time off.
Vacations must be scheduled and approved by your manager at least two
 
(2)
 
weeks in advance. Chipotle, at
 
its
 
sole discretion, may require you
 
to
 
take your
 
vacation
 
at
 
a particular
 
time, and may also refuse your request for vacation where business needs dictate (except where prohibited by law). You do
 
not
 
continue to accrue vacation during a leave of absence.
To be
 
eligible for vacation pay,
 
you must work your last scheduled day before the vacation and the first scheduled day
 
after the
 
vacation,
 
unless
 
you are
 
taking
 
an
 
excused absence on
 
those
 
days.
 
See the
 
instructions on Requesting Time Off
 
at the end of this Handbook.
Should you decide to end your employment
 
with Chipotle, unused vacation may not
 
be scheduled after you have notified Chipotle of your resignation. Unused vacation time is not
 
paid out upon termination except where required by law.
Please consult the 
Cultivate Me
 
portal or the 
Benefits

PAID
 
SICK
 
LEAVE
Chipotle provides twenty-four
 
(24) hours of paid
 
sick leave to
 
all employees*
 
each year. Where state or local law requires additional paid sick leave, Chipotle will provide such additional paid sick leave. Please consult 
Chiplinks
 
for
 
any state or local sick leave policies that may be applicable to your
 
work
location. Contact the Employee Service Center at 877-625-1919 
(option 5) 
for detailed information on how the dollar amount of your sick pay is calculated and the amount you are entitled to receive. The actual dollar amount that an employee receives may vary according to the compensation plan of the

off
 
during
 
your
 
first
 
ninety
(90) 
days of employment 
for
 
your own illness, 
but
 
have not yet
 
accrued sufficient time,
 
you may be eligible
 
to
 
use up
 
to
 
twenty-four
 
(24) 
hours of
 
paid sick
 
time
 
off
 
before
 
accruing
 
it
 
under
 
this policy You should talk to
 
your manager
 
if you
 
need to
 
use
 
sick time in this
 
circumstance.
 
Any sick time used in this manner will be counted against future accruals.
Paid sick leave
 
under
 
this policy may be used in connection
 
with the diagnosis, care, or
 
treatment
 
of an existing
 
health
 
condition
 
of, or
 
preventive
 
care
 
for, you
 
or
 
your
 
family
 
member.
 
"Family
 
member" for purposes of this policy includes a spouse, registered domestic partner, child (regardless of the child's age), parent (including a step-parent
 
or parent-in-law),
 
grandparent, grandchild, sibling. Leave under
 
this policy may also be used by an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to seek aid or
 
medical attention, obtain services or counseling, or participate in safety planning. To the
 
extent paid sick time may be used for other purposes under applicable local ordinances, such use will be permitted as required.
When requesting time off under this policy, you must provide as much advance notice as possible. If your need for paid sick leave is unforeseeable,
 
you must provide notice as soon as practicable. See the
 
instructions on Requesting Time Off
 
at the end of this Handbook.
You are encouraged
 
to
 
request
 
leave under
 
this policy
 
without
 
fear
 
of
 
retaliation. Chipotle
 
will not take
 
any
 
adverse action
 
against employees who request or utilize
 
paid
 
sick leave.
 
However, misuse or abuse of
 
this policy (e.g., misrepresenting the reason
 
for
 
use of
 
paid sick leave or using paid sick leave for an impermissible purpose) may result in disciplinary action.
Because sick time is designated to provide benefits only to existing employees who temporarily are required to miss work, unused sick time is not
 
payable at any time, including upon termination of employment for any reason.
Paid sick leave under this
 
policy may run concurrently with leave taken under local,
 
state, or federal law, including leave taken pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act.

MEDICAL
 
LEAVE
 
OF

or who have exceeded their leave allotment under this law,
 
are nonetheless eligible for medical leave according to the following policy:
You may be eligible for unpaid leaves of absence for medical reasons. Medical reasons may include illness, injury, medical and surgical procedures, and related medical conditions. You must request a leave of absence if you will be
 
unable to work for medical reasons for
 
a period in excess of
 
five (5) consecutive days.
 
Such requests are
 
subject to management approval and must be
 
made as soon as possible. Each request must be accompanied by a certification from your treating physician or a Chipotle-approved physician
 
which states that you are unable to
 
work and provides the duration of leave that you
 
require. Chipotle reserves the
 
right to require examination by a physician of Chipotle's choice prior to granting a medical leave of
 
absence under this policy. Chipotle may require periodic physician's verification of your inability to work. Misrepresenting the reason for
 
applying for a leave of absence may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
During a medical leave of absence, Chipotle's medical insurance plan documents will determine whether you and your eligible dependents may continue your health insurance coverage under Chipotle's plan. If you remain eligible for such coverage you must pay your share of
 
the
 
premium the same as if
 
you
 
continued
 
working. If you are not
 
eligible to
 
continue coverage under
 
Chipotle's plan you will be
 
issued a COBRA notice and given the option of
 
continuing coverage at your own expense. The plan
 
document
 
ultimately
 
governs
 
your
 
eligibility
 
for and entitlement
 
to
 
these benefits.
The duration of a medical leave of
 
absence will depend not
 
only on the
 
length of time your
 
doctor certifies you need but
 
also how
 
much time can be provided as a reasonable accommodation
 
without your absence causing the Company
 
to suffer
 
an undue hardship. Upon your return from a medical leave of
 
absence, we will attempt to return you
 
to your regular
 
job if it is
 
available. If it
 
is
 
not
 
available, you
 
will be placed in a similar
 
job
 
for
 
which you are deemed by management
 
to
 
be qualified if such a job
 
is
 
available. If no jobs
 
are available at the time,
 
you will be
 
given preferential consideration for any position for which you apply and for
 
which you are deemed by management
 
to
 
be qualified
 
following your
 
notifying
 
Chipotle
 
in
 
writing
 
that
 
you are ready
 
and able to
 
return
 
to
 
work.
Failure to report to work as scheduled following a leave of absence without notifying Chipotle of your need for additional leave may result in termination. Employees who are out
 
on
 
a leave of absence will not accrue such benefits as vacation or holiday pay during their leaves of
 
absence.
You should talk with your manager and contact 
benefits@chipotle.com
 
prior to taking a leave to ensure you understand your rights and obligations while on leave. Failure to comply with Chipotle policy may substantially
 
affect
 
your
 
ability to return to
 
work
 
and/or
 
result
 
in the
 
loss of
 
health insurance coverage.
OTHER
 
EMPLOYMENT
While on a leave of absence, you are prohibited from holding other employment, including self­ employment, not
 
held immediately
 
prior
 
to the start
 
of the leave. In other
 
words, if
 
you
 
have another job
 
in addition
 
to your
 
job
 
with Chipotle, you may continue
 
working
 
that
 
job while on leave
 
from Chipotle if medically able to do so,
 
but
 
you
 
may not
 
seek and hold other
 
employment
 
to replace your employment with Chipotle while on leave. This policy remains in force during all leaves of absence including
 
medical
 
leave.
 
Violation
 
of
 
this provision
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
disciplinary
 
action, up
 
to
 
and including immediate termination of employment.
FRAUD
Providing
 
false or
 
misleading
 
information
 
or
 
omitting
 
material
 
information in connection
 
with any medical
 
leave
 
will result
 
in disciplinary
 
action, up to and including
 
immediate
 
termination.
FAMILY
 
AND
 
MEDICAL
 
LEAVE
 
ACT
The Family and Medical Leave Act
 
("FMLA") provides eligible employees
 
the opportunity
 
to take unpaid, job-protected leave for
 
certain specified reasons. The maximum amount of leave you may use is either
 
twelve (12) or twenty-six
 
(26) weeks within a twelve (12) month period depending
 
on the reasons for
 
the leave.
EMPLOYEE
 ELIGIBILITY
To
 
be
 
eligible
 
for
 
FMLA
 
leave,
 
you
 
must:
Have worked at least twelve (12) months for Chipotle in the preceding seven (7)
 
years (limited exceptions apply to the seven-year requirement);
Have worked at least
 
1,250 hours for Chipotle over the twelve (12) months preceding the date your leave would begin; and
Currently
 
work
 
at
 
a
 
location
 
where
 
there
 
are
 
at
 
least
 
fifty
 
(50)
 
employees
 
within
 
seventy-
five
(75)
 
miles.
All periods of absence from work due to
 
or necessitated by service in the uniformed services are counted in determining FMLA eligibility.
REASONS
 
FOR
 
TAKING
 
LEAVE
FMLA
 
leave
 
may
 
be
 
taken
 
for
 
the
 
following
 
reasons:
Birth
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
child,
 
including
 
time
 
for
 
bonding
 
with
 
the
 
child
 
after
 
birth
 
(up
 
to
 
twelve
(12)
 
weeks).
 
Such
 
time is available
 
to
 
employees
 
regardless
 
of
 
sex, gender
 
identity
 
or 
expression;
Placement
 
of
 
a child with the
 
employee in connection
 
with the adoption
 
or foster
 
care of
 
the child by the employee (up
 
to twelve (12) weeks).
 
Such time is available to employees regardless of sex, gender identity or expression;
To care for an
 
immediate family member (employee's spouse, child or parent) with
 
a serious 
health condition (up to twelve (12) weeks);
Because of an
 
employee's serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions
 
of
 
the employee's position (up to twelve (12)
 
weeks);
To care for a Covered Servicemember
 
with a
 
serious injury or illness related to certain types of 
military service (up
 
to twenty-six (26) weeks) (see Military-Related
 
FMLA Leave for
 
more details); or
To handle certain qualifying circumstances arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, 
child, or parent is on
 
duty under
 
a call or order
 
to
 
active duty in
 
the
 
Uniformed Services (up
 
to twelve (12) weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for
 
more details).
The maximum amount of leave that may be taken in a twelve (12) month period for all reasons combined is
 
twelve (12) weeks, with one
 
exception. For leave to care
 
for a Covered Servicemember, the maximum combined leave entitlement is
 
twenty-six (26) weeks, with leaves for
 
all other reasons constituting no more than twelve (12) of
 
those twenty-six
 
(26) weeks.
DEFINITIONS
A "Serious Health Condition" is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either
 
(i)
 
an overnight
 
stay in a medical care facility, or (ii) continuing
 
treatment
 
by a health care provider
 
for a condition
 
that
 
either
 
prevents
 
the
 
employee from performing
 
the functions
 
of
 
the employee's
 
job
 
or
 
prevents the qualified family member
 
from participating in school or other
 
daily activities for more than three (3)
 
full calendar
 
days. The continuing
 
treatment
 
requirement
 
includes two
 
(2)
 
visits to a health care provider
 
or one (1) visit to a health care provider and a continuing regimen of care.
 
An incapacity caused by pregnancy or prenatal visits, a chronic condition (such as asthma, diabetes or migraines)
 
that continues over an extended period of time and requires periodic visits (at
 
least
 
two
 
(2)
 
per
 
year)
 
to
 
a health
 
care provider, permanent
 
or
 
long-term
 
conditions requiring supervision but
 
not
 
active treatment by a health care provider, or absences due to multiple treatments ordered by a health care provider may also meet the definition of a Serious Health 
Condition.
IDENTIFYING
 
THE
 
12-MONTH
 
PERIOD
Chipotle measures the
 
twelve (12) month period in which leave is taken by the "rolling" twelve (12) month method, measured
 
backward
 
from the date of any FMLA
 
leave
 
with one exception.
 
For
 
leave to care for a Covered Servicemember,
 
Chipotle calculates the twelve (12) month period beginning on the first day the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for a Covered Servicemember
 
and ends twelve (12) months after that date. FMLA
 
leave for
 
the
 
birth or placement
 
of a child for adoption or foster
 
care must
 
be concluded
 
within twelve (12) months
 
of
 
the birth or
 
placement.
USING
 
LEAVE
Eligible
 
employees
 
may
 
take
 
FMLA
 
leave
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
block
 
of
 
time,
 
intermittently (in separate
 
blocks of
 
time), or
 
by reducing
 
the
 
normal
 
work
 
schedule (including
 
the elimination
 
of
 
required
 
overtime) when medically necessary for
 
the serious health condition of the employee or immediate family member, or in the case of
 
a Covered Servicemember,
 
their injury or illness. Eligible employees may also take intermittent or reduced-schedule leave for
 
military qualifying exigencies. Employees who require
 
intermittent
 
or
 
reduced-schedule leave
 
for
 
planned
 
medical
 
treatment
 
must
 
make
 
a reasonable effort to schedule their leave so that it will not unreasonably
 
disrupt Chipotle's operations. Intermittent leave is permitted in increments of at least one (1) hour.
USE
 
OF
 
PAID
 
LEAVE
Depending on the purpose of
 
your
 
leave, Chipotle may require you
 
to
 
use accrued
 
paid leave (such as sick leave,
 
vacation, or PTO (Paid Time Off)),
 
concurrently
 
with some or all of your FMLA leave.
 
If Chipotle
 
does not
 
require you to
 
do
 
so,
 
you
 
may elect to
 
substitute
 
paid leave for
 
FMLA
 
leave, so long as you
 
comply
 
with Chipotle's
 
normal procedures
 
for
 
the applicable
 
paid-leave policy (e.g., call­ in procedures, advance notice, etc.). Additionally, depending on the purpose of your
 
leave request, you may choose
 
to
 
take leave pursuant
 
to
 
a short-
 
or long-term
 
disability
 
leave plan, during
 
the
otherwise
 
unpaid
 
portion
 
of
 
your FMLA leave.
 
This
 
paid
 
disability leave
 
runs
 
concurrently with
 
FMLA 
leave
 
and
 
may
 
continue
 
longer than
 
the
 
FMLA leave
 
if permitted
 
by
 
the
 
disability leave
 
plan.
MAINTENANCE
 
OF
 
HEALTH
 
BENEFITS
If you and/or
 
your
 
family
 
participate
 
in our
 
group health plan, Chipotle will maintain coverage during your FMLA leave on the same terms as if you
 
had continued to work.
 
If applicable, you must make arrangements to pay your share of health plan
 
premiums while on leave.
 
In
 
some instances, Chipotle may recover premiums it
 
paid to maintain health coverage or
 
other benefits for you and your
 
family. Use of
 
FMLA
 
leave
 
will not
 
result
 
in the
 
loss of
 
any employment
 
benefit
 
that accrued
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
start of your leave. Consult the applicable plan document on the 
Cultivate Me
 
portal or email 
benefits@chipotle.com
 
for all information regarding eligibility, coverage
 
and benefits.
NOTICE
 
AND
 
MEDICAL
 
CERTIFICATION
When
 
seeking
 
FMLA
 
leave,
 
you
 
must
 
provide:
Sufficient
 
information
 
for us to
 
determine if the requested leave may qualify for FMLA protection and the anticipated
 
timing and duration of the leave. Sufficient
 
information may include that you
 
are unable to
 
perform
 
job functions, a family
 
member
 
is unable to
 
perform daily activities,
 
the need
 
for
 
hospitalization
 
or continuing
 
treatment
 
by a
 
health
 
care provider, or
 
circumstances
 
supporting
 
the
 
need for
 
military
 
family
 
leave. You must also inform
 
Chipotle if the requested leave is for
 
a reason for
 
which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified.
Thirty (30) days advance notice of the
 
need to take FMLA leave,
 
if the
 
need for leave is 
foreseeable, or notice as soon as practicable in the case of unforeseeable leave and in compliance with Chipotle's normal call-in procedures, absent unusual circumstances;
Medical certification
 
supporting
 
the need for
 
leave due
 
to
 
a serious health condition affecting 
you or an immediate family member
 
within fifteen (15) calendar
 
days of Chipotle's request to provide
 
the certification
 
(additional
 
time may
 
be permitted
 
in some
 
circumstances). If
 
you
 
fail to do so, Chipotle may delay the commencement
 
of your leave, withdraw any designation of FMLA leave or deny the leave, in which case your leave of absence would be treated in accordance with our standard leave of absence and attendance policies, subjecting you to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Second or third medical opinions and periodic re-certifications may also be required;
Periodic
 
reports
 
as
 
deemed
 
appropriate
 
during
 
the
 
leave
 
regarding
 
your
 
status
 
and
 
intent
 
to 
return to work; and
Medical
 
certification of
 
fitness
 
for duty
 
before
 
returning to work,
 
if the
 
leave
 
was
 
due to your 
serious
 
health
 
condition,
 
as
 
permitted
 
by
 
law.
 
Chipotle
 
will
 
require
 
this
 
certification
 
to
 
address whether you
 
can
 
perform the
 
essential functions of
 
your position.
Failure to comply with these requirements may result in delay or denial of leave, or disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
EMPLOVER
 
RESPONSIBlLITIES
To the
 
extent required by law, Chipotle will inform you whether
 
you are eligible for leave under the FMLA. If you are eligible for FMLA/CFRA
 
leave, Chipotle will provide you with a notice that specifies any
 
additional
 
information
 
required
 
as
 
well
 
as your
 
rights and
 
responsibilities. Chipotle
 
will also inform
 
you if
 
leave
 
will be designated
 
as FMLA-protected and, to
 
the
 
extent
 
possible, note the amount of leave counted against your leave entitlement. If you are not
 
eligible for FMLA leave, Chipotle will provide a reason for
 
the ineligibility.
JOB
 
RESTORATION
To the
 
extent required by applicable law,
 
upon
 
returning from FMLA leave, you
 
will be
 
restored to the same or a comparable
 
position as the
 
position held prior to the leave.
FAILURE
 
TO
 
RETURN
 
AFTER
 
FMLA
 
LEAVE
If you fail to return to work as scheduled after FMLA leave or you exceed the twelve (12) week FMLA entitlement
 
(or
 
in the case
 
of
 
military
 
caregiver
 
leave, the
 
twenty-six
 
(26)
 
week
 
FMLA
 
entitlement), you
 
will be subject to Chipotle's standard leave of absence and attendance policies. This may result in termination
 
if
 
you have no
 
other
 
Chipotle-provided leave available
 
to
 
you
 
that
 
applies
 
to
 
your continued absence. Likewise, following the conclusion of your FMLA leave, Chipotle's obligation to maintain
 
your
 
group
 
health
 
plan
 
benefits
 
may
 
end
 
(subject
 
to
 
any
 
applicable
 
COBRA
 
rights). If
 
you are unable to return to work after FMLA leave, you must notify your manager and 
benefits@chipotle.com
.
 
If Chipotle becomes aware of
 
the
 
need for additional leave, Chipotle will engage
 
in an interactive
 
process
 
to
 
determine
 
whether
 
the
 
condition
 
is a
 
disability
 
for
 
which additional unpaid leave may be provided as a reasonable accommodation.
OTHER
 
EMPLOYMENT
While on a leave of absence, you are prohibited from holding other employment, including self­ employment, not
 
held immediately
 
prior
 
to the start
 
of the leave. In other
 
words, if
 
you
 
have another job
 
in addition
 
to your
 
job
 
with Chipotle, you may continue
 
working
 
that
 
job while on leave
 
from Chipotle if medically able to do so,
 
but
 
you
 
may not
 
seek and hold other
 
employment
 
to replace your employment with Chipotle while on leave. This policy remains in force during all leaves of absence including FMLA leave. Violation of this provision may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment.
FRAUD
Providing
 
false or misleading
 
information
 
or
 
omitting material
 
information in connection
 
with an FMLA
 
leave will result in disciplinary
 
action, up to and including immediate
 
termination.
MILITARY-RELATED
 
FMLA
 
LEAVE
FMLA leave may also be available to eligible employees in connection with certain service-related medical and
 
non-medical needs of family members. There are
 
two
 
forms of such
 
leave.
 
The first is Military Caregiver
 
Leave, and the second is Qualifying Exigency Leave.
 
Each of these leaves is detailed below.
DEFINITIONS
A "Covered Servicemember" is either: (1) a current Servicemember
 
of the Armed Forces, including a member
 
of the National Guard or Reserves, with a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of
 
duty for which the Servicemember
 
is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation,
 
or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient
 
status, or is otherwise
 
on the
 
temporary
 
disability
 
retired list; or
 
(2)
 
a "covered veteran" who is undergoing
 
medical
 
treatment, recuperation, or therapy
 
for
 
a serious injury or illness.
A "Covered Veteran" is an individual who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable during the five (5)
 
year
 
period prior
 
to the first date the eligible employee takes FMLA
 
leave to
 
care for the covered veteran. The period between October 28, 2009 and March 8, 2013 is excluded in determining this five (5) year period.
The FMLA definitions of "serious injury or illness" for current Servicemembers and veterans are distinct
 
from the FMLA
 
definition of "serious health
 
condition." For
 
purposes
 
of
 
Military-Related FMLA Leave, the
 
term "serious injury or illness" means an injury or illness incurred by the Servicemember
 
in the
 
line of
 
duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render
 
the Servicemember
 
medically
 
unfit to perform the duties of the Servicemember's office, grade, rank, or rating, or one that existed before the beginning
 
of active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty.
With regard to covered veterans, the serious injury or illness may manifest itself before or after the individual assumed veteran status, and is:
 
1) a continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated
 
when the covered veteran
 
was a member
 
of
 
the
 
Armed Forces and rendered the
 
Servicemember
 
unable to
 
perform
 
the duties of
 
the Servicemember's
 
office, grade, rank
 
or
 
rating;
2) a physical or mental condition for which the covered veteran has received a VA Service Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50
 
percent or greater and such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the condition
 
precipitating
 
the need
 
for
 
caregiver
 
leave; 3)
 
a
 
physical
 
or
 
mental
 
condition that
 
substantially
 
impairs
 
the
 
veteran's
 
ability
 
to
 
secure
 
or
 
follow
 
a substantially
 
gainful
 
occupation by reason
 
of
 
a
 
disability
 
or
 
disabilities
 
related
 
to
 
military
 
service
 
or
 
would
 
be so absent
 
treatment;
 
or
4) an injury,
 
including a psychological injury,
 
on the basis of which the covered veteran has been enrolled in
 
the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family 
Caregivers.
"Qualifying exigencies" include activities such as short-notice deployment, military events, arranging alternative childcare, making financial and legal arrangements related to the deployment, rest and recuperation, counseling, parental care, and post-deployment debriefings.
MILITARY
 
CAREGIVER
 
LEAVE
Unpaid Military Caregiver Leave is designed to allow eligible employees to care for certain family members who have sustained serious injuries or illnesses in the line of duty while on active duty.
 
The family member must be
 
a "Covered Servicemember," which means:
 
1) a current member or veteran of the
 
Armed
 
Forces, National
 
Guard
 
or
 
Reserves,
 
2)
 
who
 
is undergoing
 
medical
 
treatment, recuperation, or therapy
 
or,
 
in
 
the
 
case of
 
a veteran, who
 
was a member
 
of
 
the
 
Armed Forces, National Guard or Reserves, who
 
was discharged or released under conditions other than
 
dishonorable
 
at
 
any time within
 
five years
 
prior
 
to
 
the treatment
 
which
 
an eligible
 
employee
 
requests; is
 
otherwise
 
in
 
outpatient
 
status;
 
or
 
is
 
otherwise
 
on
 
the
 
temporary
 
disability
 
retired
 
list, 3)
 
for
 
a serious injury or illness that may render
 
current
 
member
 
medically
 
unfit
 
to perform the duties of
 
the member's office, grade, rank, or rating. Military Caregiver Leave is not
 
available to care for Servicemembers on the 
permanent
 
disability retired list. Serious injury or illness specifically
 
includes, but
 
is not
 
limited to, aggravation
 
of a preexisting
 
condition
 
while in the
 
line of
 
duty.
To be
 
eligible for Military Caregiver
 
Leave, you must be a spouse, child, parent, or next of kin of the Covered Servicemember.
 
"Next of kin" means the
 
nearest blood relative of the Servicemember,
 
other than the Servicemember's spouse, parent, child, in the following
 
order
 
of priority: blood relatives
 
who have been granted legal custody
 
of
 
the Servicemember
 
by
 
court
 
decree
 
or
 
statutory
 
provisions; sibling; grandparents; parent's siblings; and first cousins; unless the Servicemember has specifically designated in writing another
 
blood relative as their nearest blood relative
 
for
 
purposes
 
of Military Caregiver
 
Leave. You
 
must also meet all other eligibility standards as set forth within the
 
FMLA Leave 
policy.
An eligible employee may take up to twenty-six
 
(26) workweeks of Military Caregiver
 
Leave to
 
care for a Covered Servicemember in
 
a "single twelve (12) month period."
 
The "single twelve (12) month period" begins on the
 
first day leave is
 
taken to
 
care for
 
a Covered Servicemember
 
and
 
ends twelve
(12) months thereafter, regardless of the method used to determine leave availability for other FMLA­ qualifying reasons. If you do not exhaust your twenty-six (26) workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave during this "single twelve (12) month period," the remainder
 
is forfeited.
Military
 
Caregiver
 
Leave
 
applies on
 
a
 
per-injury basis
 
for each
 
Servicemember.
 
Consequently, an eligible employee may take separate periods of caregiver leave for
 
each and every Covered Servicemember,
 
and/or for each and every serious injury or illness of the same Covered Servicemember. A total of no
 
more than twenty-six (26) workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave, however, may be taken within any single twelve (12) month period.
Within the "single twelve (12) month period" described above, an eligible employee may take a combined total of twenty-six (26) weeks of FMLA leave including up to twelve (12) weeks of
 
leave for any other
 
FMLA-qualifying reason (i.e., birth or adoption
 
of a child, serious health condition
 
of the employee or close family member, or a qualifying exigency). For example, during the "single twelve
(12) month period,"
 
an
 
eligible
 
employee may take
 
up to sixteen (16) weeks of
 
FMLA
 
leave to
 
care for a Covered Servicemember
 
when combined with up
 
to ten
 
(10) weeks of FMLA leave to
 
care for a newborn child.
An employee seeking Military Caregiver Leave may be required to provide appropriate certification from the employee and/or Covered Servicemember
 
and completed by an authorized health care provider within fifteen (15) days. Military Caregiver Leave is subject to the other provisions in our FMLA Leave Policy (requirements regarding employee eligibility, appropriate notice of the need for leave,
 
use of
 
accrued paid leave,
 
etc.).
 
Military Caregiver Leave will be
 
governed by,
 
and handled in accordance
 
with, the FMLA and applicable regulations, and nothing within this policy should be construed to be inconsistent
 
with those regulations.
QUALIFYING
 
EXIGENCY
 
LEAVE
Eligible employees
 
may take unpaid "Qualifying Exigency Leave" to
 
tend to certain "exigencies" arising out
 
of
 
the
 
duty under
 
a call or
 
order
 
to
 
active duty
 
of a "covered
 
military member" 
(i.e.,
 
the employee's spouse, child, or parent). Up to
 
twelve (12) weeks of Qualifying Exigency Leave is available in any twelve (12) month period, as measured by the same method that governs measurement
 
of
 
other
 
forms of FMLA
 
leave
 
within the FMLA
 
policy (with the
 
exception
 
of
 
Military Caregiver
 
Leave, which is
 
subject
 
to a maximum
 
of twenty-six
 
(26) weeks of
 
leave in
 
a "single twelve
(12)
 
month
 
period").
 
The
 
maximum
 
amount
 
of
 
"Qualifying
 
Exigency
 
Leave"
 
an
 
employee
 
may
 
utilize to
 
bond
 
with a military
 
member
 
on short-term, temporary
 
rest and recuperation
 
during
 
deployment
 
is fifteen (15) days.
Although Qualifying Exigency Leave may be combined with leave for
 
other FMLA-qualifying reasons, under no circumstances may the combined total exceed twelve (12) weeks in any twelve (12) month period (with
 
the
 
exception
 
of
 
Military
 
Caregiver
 
Leave
 
as set
 
forth above). The employee
 
must
 
meet all other
 
eligibility
 
standards as set forth within the FMLA
 
policy.
Persons who
 
can be ordered to active duty include active and retired members of the Regular
 
Armed Forces, certain members of the retired Reserve, and various other Reserve members including the Ready Reserve,
 
the
 
Selected
 
Reserve, the Individual Ready Reserve, the
 
National Guard,
 
state military,
 
Army
 
Reserve,
 
Navy
 
Reserve,
 
Marine
 
Corps
 
Reserve, Air National
 
Guard,
 
Air Force
 
Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve.
A call to
 
active duty refers to
 
a 
federal 
call to
 
active duty,
 
and
 
state

active duty are not covered
 
unless
 
under
 
the
 
order
 
of
 
the

the
 
United
 
States

the covered
 
military
 
member's
 
active-duty

the
 
military
 
member,
 
within
 
fifteen
 
(15)

Qualifying Exigency Leave will be governed by,
 
and handled in accordance with, the FMLA and applicable

to
 
be inconsistent

PERSONAL
 
LEAVE
 
OF
 
ABSENCE
Additional types of unpaid personal leaves of absence may be granted in the sole discretion of management,
 
for
 
up
 
to
 
a maximum
 
of
 
thirty (30) days. An extension
 
beyond thirty (30) days
 
will be considered on an individual basis.
Failure to report to work as
 
scheduled following a personal leave of absence may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Time spent on personal leave of
 
absence will not be used for computing benefits such as vacation or holidays.
You should speak directly with your manager and 
benefits@chipotle.com
 
prior to taking a leave to ensure your understanding of all of your obligations to Chipotle while on leave, such as your periodic reporting and re-verification obligations.
 
Failure
 
to
 
comply
 
with Chipotle's
 
policy may substantially affect
 
your
 
ability to return to
 
work
 
under
 
this policy.
BEREAVEMENT
 
LEAVE
Full-time employees may be eligible for bereavement
 
leave. More information about this benefit can be found in the 
Cultivate Me
 
portal.
Salaried employees may be provided time off
 
with
 
pay for any of the above-described
 
leaves when necessary to comply with state and federal wage and hour laws.
COURTESY
 
AND
 
PROFESSIONALISM
Employees
 
who
 
engage in contact
 
with guests, vendors, and/or
 
members of
 
the public in the course of their job duties must show such persons courtesy and professionalism
 
at all times.
 
Rudeness or profanity in the presence of our guests, vendors, and/or
 
members of
 
the
 
public
 
will not be tolerated, and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Cooperation and respect amongst team members while fulfilling their job duties is necessary to ensure the highest quality service to
 
our guests. This is not
 
intended to conflict or limit employees' rights under the National Labor
 
Relations
 
Act
 
including the rights to discuss
 
wages, hours, and other
 
working
 
conditions.
Failure to conduct oneself professionally and live Chipotle's values in the presence of our guests, vendors, and/or
 
members of the public creates a difficult
 
working environment
 
and prevents Chipotle from providing quality service to our guests.
If you consistently
 
fail to approach your job duties in
 
a professional manner in
 
the presence of guests, vendors,
 
and/or
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
public,
 
you may
 
be
 
subject
 
to
 
disciplinary
 
action,
 
up
 
to
 
and including termination.
 
We encourage positive and collaborative interactions at Chipotle that create leadership and teamwork in the presence of
 
guests, vendors, and/or
 
members of the public.

Failure to
 
comply with Chipotle's food safety programs and practices, including audits, training, or failure to
 
timely
 
complete
 
food safety
 
compliance
 
requirements,
 
may result
 
in disciplinary
 
action, up to and including termination.
This employee Handbook does not
 
list all the requirements and responsibilities

ALCOHOL
 
AND
 
DRUG
 
POLICY
All employees are prohibited from manufacturing,
 
cultivating, distributing, dispensing, possessing, or using illegal drugs and cannabis or THC-containing products (regardless of prescription) or other unauthorized,
 
mind-altering,
 
or intoxicating
 
substances
 
while on Chipotle property
 
(including
 
parking areas and grounds), or while otherwise performing their work duties away from Chipotle's premises. Included
 
within
 
this prohibition
 
are lawful
 
controlled
 
substances
 
which
 
have been
 
illegally
 
or improperly
 
obtained. This policy
 
does not
 
prohibit
 
the possession
 
and proper
 
use of
 
lawfully prescribed drugs taken in accordance with the prescription, other than cannabis or THC-containing 
products.
Employees are also prohibited from being under the influence of any such illegal or unauthorized controlled substances (and cannabis or THC-containing products regardless of prescription)
 
while at work and from having excessive amounts of otherwise lawful controlled substances in their systems.
All
 
employees are prohibited from distributing, dispensing, possessing, or using alcohol while at work or on duty. Furthermore,
 
off-duty alcohol use, while generally not
 
prohibited by this policy, must not interfere
 
with your
 
ability
 
to perform
 
the essential
 
functions
 
of
 
your
 
job.
 
From
 
time to
 
time, Chipotle may host events where alcohol is served. During these authorized Chipotle events, employees are permitted to engage in moderate consumption
 
of alcohol that is served. Employees
 
are expected to exercise good personal judgement
 
concerning alcohol consumption
 
and must not
 
overindulge.
PRESCRIPTION
 
DRUGS
With the exception of medically prescribed cannabis or THC-containing products, the proper use of medication prescribed by your
 
physician is not
 
prohibited
 
while working; however, we do
 
prohibit
 
the misuse of prescribed medication. Employees' drug use may affect their safety and job performance, such as
 
by
 
causing dizziness or drowsiness. You are
 
required to disclose to your manager any medication
 
that may cause a risk of
 
harm to
 
yourself
 
or to
 
others in performing your
 
job
 
duties. It
 
is your
 
responsibility to determine from your
 
physician
 
whether
 
a prescribed
 
drug may impair
 
your
 
job 
performance.
NOTIFICATION
 
OF
 
IMPAIRMENT
Each employee who observes or has knowledge of another employee in a condition which impairs the employee in the performance of their job duties, or who presents a hazard to the safety and welfare
 
of
 
others, or
 
is otherwise
 
in violation
 
of
 
this policy, must
 
promptly
 
report
 
that
 
fact
 
to
 
their manager or another member of management.
WHO
 
IS
 
TESTED?
You may be required to submit to drug or alcohol screening whenever Chipotle has a reasonable suspicion
 
that you have violated any of
 
the
 
rules set
 
forth in
 
this policy. Reasonable
 
suspicion
 
may arise from, among other
 
factors, supervisory
 
observation, co-worker
 
reports or complaints, performance decline, attendance or behavioral changes, results of searches or other detection methods, or involvement
 
in a work-related injury or accident that may have been caused by drug or alcohol
 
impairment
 
(to
 
the extent permitted
 
by applicable
 
law). Injury or accident-based testing
 
does not
 
apply
 
where
 
the
 
incident
 
or
 
accident
 
is unlikely
 
to
 
have
 
occurred
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
drug
 
or alcohol use, or
 
where the
 
cause of
 
the
 
incident
 
or injury is known or clear (e.g., back sprains from lifting a heavy object, bug bites that require treatment, etc.).
Additionally, employees in safety sensitive positions may be tested on
 
a random or periodic basis to the
 
extent permitted by applicable state and federal laws.
ENFORCEMENT
 
POLICY
In order to enforce this policy and procedures, Chipotle may investigate potential violations and require employees to undergo drug or alcohol screening, including urinalysis, blood tests, or other appropriate tests (as permitted by
 
applicable law) and, where appropriate, searches of all areas of Chipotle's physical premises, including, but not limited to work areas,
 
personal articles, employee's clothes, desks, workstations, lockers, and personal and Chipotle vehicles.
DISCIPLINE
Violation
 
of this policy or any of
 
its
 
provisions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination
 
of
 
employment.
 
Violations
 
include but

DAMAGE
 
TO
 
PROPERTY
Deliberate or careless damage to a co-worker's, vendor's, or guest's property or Chipotle's property will not
 
be tolerated and may result
 
in disciplinary
 
action, up to
 
and including
 
termination
 
of 
employment.
Any personal
 
property
 
brought
 
to
 
work
 
is your
 
sole responsibility. Chipotle will not be responsible
 
for an employee's lost or damaged personal property..
FRAUD,
 
DISHONESTY,
 
AND
 
FALSE
 
STATEMENTS
Employees
 
and
 
applicants
 
are prohibited
 
from
 
providing
 
false,
 
dishonest,
 
or
 
misleading
 
information on any application, medical history record, leave request, invoice, time entry, investigative questionnaire and meetings, workplace injury report, or any other Chipotle document. Employees are likewise prohibited
 
from making any maliciously
 
false statements
 
to
 
an employee, customer, partner, or
 
third party. Under
 
the
 
law, an
 
employee
 
may
 
be
 
held personally
 
liable
 
for
 
making
 
knowingly
 
false or defamatory statements to guests.
Any employee found to have made knowingly false, or
 
defamatory statements as detailed above will be subject
 
to
 
immediate
 
termination
 
of
 
employment.
 
If
 
you observe
 
any
 
such
 
violations,
 
please report them to your HR Business Partner if you are
 
in the RSC, the
 
RWH Team if you
 
are
 
in
 
a restaurant, or to any other member of management.
GAMBLING
Gambling is prohibited on Chipotle property, or through the use of Chipotle's property, such as computers and telephone equipment, and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
GIFTS
 
AND
 
ENTERTAINMENT
Our success depends in a large part on the relationships we develop with our suppliers and business partners, which may involve exchanging
 
gifts, sharing business
 
meals, attending
 
entertainment events, and
 
other business courtesies.
 
However, we
 
must be
 
careful to make sure
 
that these
 
activities do not
 
create
 
or
 
appear
 
to
 
create a
 
sense of
 
obligation
 
on either
 
party
 
or
 
compromise
 
our professional judgment as Chipotle employees. Please refer our 
Code of Ethics
 
for information on
 
our policy regarding Gifts and Entertainment.
ILLEGAL
 
ACTIVITY
Employees
 
are
 
not
 
permitted
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
any
 
kind
 
of
 
illegal
 
activity
 
while
 
on
 
duty
 
or
 
on
 
Chipotle's premises/facilities,
 
or while
 
off the job which
 
reflects
 
detrimentally on
 
Chipotle's reputation.
Employees
 
who
 
engage in illegal activity may be disciplined or terminated
 
and may also be reported to law enforcement.
INSUBORDINATION
We all have duties to perform, and every employee must follow directions from their manager. Employees must not refuse to
 
follow the reasonable, job-related
 
directions of a member
 
of management
 
or to
 
otherwise treat a member
 
of management
 
in
 
an
 
insubordinate
 
manner as it
 
relates to the performance of their job duties. Employees who
 
engage in insubordinate conduct may be disciplined
 
or
 
terminated. This requirement
 
is not
 
intended to
 
conflict
 
with or
 
limit employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act, including the rights to discuss wages, hours, and any other working conditions.
MISUSE
 
OF
 
PROPERTY
Employees are prohibited from misusing, or using without authorization,
 
equipment, vehicles or the property of Chipotle, guests, vendors, or other employees of Chipotle. Any non-business use of Chipotle's office equipment must be approved by management. Misuse of
 
property may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
OFF-DUTY
 
USE
 
OF
 
CHIPOTLE
 
FACILITIES/PREMISES
Employees are prohibited from being inside Chipotle premises or any external working areas if they interfere with other employees who are working. Employees are expressly prohibited from using Chipotle facilities, property, or equipment
 
for personal use. Violation of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
OFF-DUTY
 
SOCIAL
 
AND
 
RECREATIONAL
 
ACTIVITIES
During the year, Chipotle may sponsor social or recreational activities for its employees. Your attendance at these events is completely
 
voluntary and not
 
required as a condition of employment, and
 
the
 
time
 
spent
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
considered
 
time
 
worked.
 
Neither
 
Chipotle
 
nor
 
its
 
insurer
 
will
 
be 
liable
employees. Employees who are provided with uniforms must keep them in
 
a neat and clean condition and must wear them at all times when on duty.
You should dress and present yourself in a manner that reflects the professionalism that you
 
bring to teaching
 
and tasting Chipotle every
 
day. We feel
 
that
 
these qualities
 
go
 
further
 
than any
 
other
 
factor in making a favorable impression
 
on guests and your co-workers and also help to keep you
safe. Employees
 
who
 
report
 
to work in attire that violates Chipotle's
 
Uniform
 
Policy may be required to
 
leave
 
work and return in acceptable
 
attire. Such time away
 
from
 
work
 
will be without
 
pay.
Chipotle
 
will not
 
enforce this policy in violation
 
of any federal, state, or local equal employment opportunity
 
laws. Chipotle will provide reasonable accommodations to this policy for an employee's religious beliefs and practices, medical needs, or other protected reasons, provided the requested accommodation
 
does not
 
create an undue hardship
 
for
 
Chipotle and/or
 
does not
 
pose a direct
 
threat to
 
the health
 
or
 
safety
 
of
 
others
 
in the
 
workplace
 
and/or
 
to
 
the individual. Once Chipotle is aware
 
of the need for an accommodation,
 
Chipotle will engage in an interactive process to identify possible accommodations. For more information, please see the
 
Reasonable Accommodation
 
Policy
.
YOUR
 
PERFORMANCE
You are expected to make every effort to learn your
 
job and to
 
perform at a level satisfactory
 
to Chipotle at all times. This includes following through on the reasonable, job-related instructions and requests of your managers. Consistent failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
PERFORMANCE
 
FEEDBACK
All employees receive performance feedback at regular intervals. Additionally, Chipotle encourages you
 
to
 
talk
 
with your
 
manager
 
about
 
your
 
future goals and growth. Do not
 
feel
 
that
 
you
 
need to

a
 
formal
 
feedback
 
meeting
 
to
 
discuss
 
job
 
issues, your
 
career
 
opportunities,
 
or your

PERSONAL
 
RELATIONSHIP
 
POLICY
Chipotle is committed
 
to maintaining a friendly, but
 
professional
 
working
 
environment. The purpose of this policy is to
 
provide guidelines
 
for
 
employees
 
who have or develop personal
 
relationships
 
in
the
 
workplace.
 
This
 
policy
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
prevent
 
potential
 
issues
 
that
 
may
 
arise
 
from
 
such relationships,
 
including but not limited to problems/perceptions
 
with
 
supervision and favoritism, 
potential
 
conflicts
 
of
 
interest,
 
safety
 
and
 
security,
 
morale,
 
and
 
other issues
 
that
 
may
 
cause
 
disruption 
or
 
create
 
a
 
negative
 
or
 
unprofessional
 
work
 
environment.
EMPLOYMENT
 
OF
 
RELATIVES
While
 
Chipotle
 
does not
 
prohibit
 
the hiring
 
relatives
 
of
 
employees,
 
family
 
members
 
will typically
 
not be eligible for employment
 
with Chipotle where potential problems of supervision, safety, security or morale, or
 
potential conflicts
 
of interest
 
exist. More specifically,
 
family
 
members
 
will not
 
be hired into or
 
transferred
 
into
 
positions
 
where
 
they
 
would
 
have
 
authority
 
over,
 
direct
 
or
 
indirect
 
supervision
 
of, or would otherwise be supervised by another family member.
Chipotle also reserves the
 
right to determine if a close enough familial relationship exists to
 
prohibit a supervisory relationship. It further reserves the right to take all steps it deems necessary to
 
prevent conflicts of interest.
For the purposes of this policy, "family member" shall include a spouse, parent, domestic partner, child, sibling, parent's
 
sibling, grandparent,
 
grandchild,
 
sibling's child, in-law or
 
step-relative,
 
cousins, a relative of a domestic partner in one of these relationships,
 
or any person residing in the same household as the
 
employee.
ROMANTIC/PHYSICAL
 
RELATIONSHIP
 
POLICY
 
FOR
 
MANAGERS
Any involvement of a romantic or consensual physical and/or sexual nature between any supervisory employee
 
and any subordinate
 
employee, either
 
directly
 
or indirectly, must be immediately
 
reported by both
 
participating employees to the Team Director, Functional Leader, or HR Business Partner if you are
 
in
 
the RSC, or RWH Team if you
 
are
 
in a restaurant.
Once
 
reported,
 
the
 
Team Director and/or Functional Leader or respective
 
HR Business Partner or RWH Team representative
 
will meet with the respective employees to discuss the
 
best course of action and will take all steps it
 
deems necessary
 
to
 
prevent conflicts of interest.
RELATIONSHIPS
 
BETWEEN
 
NON-MANAGERIAL
 
ADULT
 
EMPLOYEES
Chipotle expects all adult employees involved in a consensual physical, sexual and/or romantic relationship while working for Chipotle to behave professionally
 
at all times. Such employees must avoid inappropriate behavior
 
while at the workplace or while on Chipotle's paid time or business, including refraining from public displays of affection, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, and sexually oriented joking.
If Chipotle determines
 
that a relationship
 
between two
 
peer
 
employees
 
with no
 
reporting relationship presents an actual or potential conflict of interest
 
or is disruptive in a manner
 
inconsistent
 
with the goals
 
of
 
this policy, Chipotle
 
reserves
 
the
 
right
 
to take
 
all steps it
 
deems
 
necessary
 
to
 
prevent conflicts of interest.
ROMANTIC/PHYSICAL
 
RELATIONSHIPS
 
WITH
 
MINOR
 
EMPLOYEES
 
ARE
 
STRICTLY
 
PROHIBITED
All employees, including supervisory employees and employee peers,
 
are prohibited from engaging in or pursuing romantic, physical and/or
 
sexual relationships
 
with any minor
 
employee
 
under
 
the age of
18. All
 
employees are further
 
prohibited from engaging in
 
conduct
 
with any minor employee that may create
 
the
 
appearance
 
of
 
impropriety
 
or lead to
 
conduct
 
that is not
 
in
 
Chipotle's
 
interest. This policy will be strictly
 
enforced,
 
and any
 
violation
 
will result
 
in
 
termination
 
of
 
employment.
All employees must also remember that Chipotle maintains a strict policy against unlawful harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment.
SMOKING
Smoking is prohibited in all Chipotle buildings and vehicles. This policy specifically extends to electronic
 
cigarettes ("e-cigarettes") and any other personal vaporizing devices.
 
Smoking must be confined to designated outdoor areas. Of course,
 
smoking is
 
prohibited in
 
all areas where hazardous and
 
flammable
 
materials
 
are present. Violation
 
of
 
this policy
 
will result
 
in
 
disciplinary
 
action, up to and including termination.
SOLICITATION
 
-
 
DISTRIBUTION
 
POLICY
Our primary goal at Chipotle is to
 
provide our guests with the
 
best service possible. In order
 
to allow employees
 
to
 
perform
 
their
 
job duties and provide our
 
guests
 
with their
 
undivided attention, the solicitation by an employee of another
 
employee
 
for
 
the support
 
of any organization
 
is prohibited during
 
the
 
working
 
time
 
of
 
either
 
employee.
 
In addition,
 
the distribution
 
of
 
paper
 
advertising materials,
 
handbills
 
or
 
other
 
literature
 
is
 
prohibited
 
during
 
working
 
time
 
and is prohibited
 
in all working areas and sales areas at all times. Working areas include those areas of restaurants where employees perform their job duties or responsibilities.
 
Similarly, non-employees may not
 
come on to Chipotle's
 
property
 
at any
 
time to
 
solicit
 
for
 
any
 
cause
 
or
 
distribute
 
material
 
or
 
literature
 
of
 
any
 
kind for any purpose. Violation
 
of
 
this policy
 
may lead
 
to
 
disciplinary
 
action, up
 
to
 
and including termination, as permitted by applicable law.
THEFT
Theft of money
 
or property from Chipotle,
 
your co-workers, or guests
 
is
 
strictly prohibited and
 
a crime
 
punishable
 
by
 
state
 
and/or federal
 
laws.
 
Employees
 
found
 
to
 
have
 
stolen
 
or
 
misappropriated money or property will
 
be
 
subject to immediate termination and will
 
also be
 
reported to law 
enforcement.
 
Chipotle
 
reserves the right
 
to
 
inspect all
 
handbags,
 
briefcases,
 
backpacks, packages, 
lockers,
 
and
 
vehicles
 
on
 
Chipotle's
 
property
 
to
 
investigate
 
allegations
 
of
 
theft.
 
Failure
 
to
 
cooperate
 
in such
 
a
 
search will
 
result
 
in
 
disciplinary action,
 
up
 
to
 
and
 
including termination.
WORKPLACE
 
VIOLENCE
 
POLICY
Chipotle has a zero-tolerance
 
policy for violent acts or threats of violence against our employees, applicants, guests, or vendors. Our full policy is linked 
here
.
We do
 
not
 
allow fighting, violent, or threatening
 
words, or conduct. Employees, visitors, and guests are strictly prohibited
 
from bringing dangerous
 
weapons on Chipotle premises, including in Chipotle vehicles, except as authorized by Safety and Asset Protection.
No employee may commit
 
or threaten to
 
commit any violent act against a co-worker
 
or Third Parties. This
 
includes discussions of the use
 
of
 
dangerous weapons, such
 
as
 
bombs,
 
guns,
 
or
 
knives,
 
even
 
in
 
a joking manner, made by employees or non-employees (e.g.,
 
guests, vendors, former employees, personal relationship partners/friends, etc.).
Employees who are subjected to or threatened
 
with violence in the workplace or are aware of another
 
individual who has been subjected to or threatened
 
with violence, are to
 
report this information to their manager, People Experience, or Safety 
& 
Asset Protection as soon as
 
possible.
All threats should be taken seriously. Please bring
 
ill_[ 
threats to our attention so that we
 
can deal with them
 
appropriately.
 
All
 
threats
 
will
 
be thoroughly
 
investigated,
 
and
 
all
 
complaints
 
which
 
are
 
reported to management
 
will be treated with as much confidentiality as possible. Employees
 
who
 
threaten or commit
 
acts of
 
violence
 
may
 
be subject
 
to
 
disciplinary
 
action, up
 
to
 
and including
 
termination.
BACKGROUND

KEYS/ENTRY
 
CARDS

whom a key and/or entry card is given is responsible
 
for proper use of
 
that key and/or
 
entry
 
card and
 
may
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
sign
 
for
 
it.
 
A
 
lost or
 
misplaced
 
key and/or
 
entry

entry cards prior to beginning their leave.
HAZARDOUS
 
AND
 
TOXIC
 
MATERIALS
If your job requires that you
 
use hazardous or toxic materials or chemicals, you are expected to comply with all laws,
 
rules,
 
and regulations concerning their safe handling and disposal. If you have any questions about the materials you work with or the proper safety or disposal procedures
 
to follow, please refer to the 
Safety Data Sheets
 
found on Chiplinks > Quick Links. If you need additional assistance, please reach out
 
to your manager or 
EHS@Chipotle.com
 
to discuss 
before 
taking any action.
HOUSEKEEPING
Work areas must be maintained in
 
a clean,
 
healthy,
 
and orderly fashion to prevent unsafe conditions 
and
 
potential
 
accidents.
 
If
 
you
 
observe
 
potential
 
workplace
 
hazards,
 
conditions,
 
or
 
equipment that may
 
be
 
dangerous
 
to
 
you
 
or
 
your
 
co-workers,
 
report
 
them
 
immediately to
 
your
 
manager.
 
It
 
is
 
each employee's
 
responsibility
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
the work
 
environment
 
is
 
always
 
maintained
 
in
 
a
 
hygienic, unobstructed,
 
and
 
organized
 
manner to prevent
 
accidents.
MEETINGS
From
 
time to
 
time, individual
 
or
 
group meetings may be scheduled
 
either
 
during or
 
outside of
 
your normal working hours. You are required to attend all job-related
 
meetings which you have been asked to attend, unless excused by your manager. If you are an hourly employee, you must report your time attending such meetings, and will be paid for your
 
time.
PARKING
To maintain sufficient and convenient parking for our guests, we require all of our employees to
 
park their vehicles in the
 
area designated
 
for
 
employee parking where applicable. If you have any questions as to
 
where you should park your vehicle, please ask your manager.
EMPLOYEE
 
RECORDS
Recognizing the confidential nature of the information in your employee records, Chipotle limits access to the employee records to you and those with proper authorization or pursuant to legal 
process.
No documents
 
or other information contained in your
 
employee records
 
will be released
 
without
 
your consent, except
 
pursuant
 
to
 
legal process.
 
Any records
 
of
 
medical
 
evaluation
 
results
 
will be maintained in a separate file, in accordance with legal requirements, and may only be reviewed by authorized individuals.
You may review your
 
own employee records
 
with your HR Business Partner
 
if you are in the
 
RSC or the RWH Team if you
 
are in the restaurants. Additionally, a manager may review your employee records if you have a current reporting relationship
 
to that manager
 
or have been interviewed and are being considered for a position reporting to that manager. Your employee records also are subject to review by
 
investigative
 
agencies, or
 
during periodic internal audits conducted
 
by Chipotle.
Within thirty (30) days of
 
an employee's
 
written request, or
 
the
 
written request
 
of
 
the
 
employee's designated representative,
 
Chipotle will either make employee records available to the employee for inspection or provide a copy of the employee's employee records to the employee or the employee's designated representative. The employee may be responsible
 
for
 
the cost of copying the records.
SAFETY
It
 
is Chipotle's
 
policy
 
to
 
promote safety
 
on
 
the
 
job, and all
 
employees
 
have a
 
responsibility
 
for creating a safe work environment. The health and well-being
 
of our employees is Chipotle's top priority. For this reason, every employee is urged to follow common sense safety practices, and immediately
 
report any observed unsafe conditions to their manager. By reporting potentially unsafe conditions, you are helping Chipotle identify the hazard, correct it, and implement
 
preventative measures
 
to
 
keep you and your
 
peers from illness, injury, or harm
 
while performing your
 
normal duties.
 
You
 
will 
not
 
be reprimanded
 
for
 
reporting
 
potentially
 
unsafe condition(s), but
 
rather
 
will be appreciated
 
for
 
bringing
 
it
 
to management's
 
attention
 
so it
 
can be appropriately
 
addressed.
Remember:
 
safety
 
is 
everyone's
 
responsibility,
 
not
 
only
 
the
 
managers'.
 
You
 
are
 
a
 
critical
 
part
 
of
 
the 
solution.
Chipotle will provide a safe working environment
 
for its employees in compliance with applicable occupational health and safety laws and
 
regulations. Management is
 
responsible for ensuring that all employees adhere to
 
safe work practices and procedures
 
to prevent injuries and are allotting adequate time for employees to
 
complete training is related to
 
their
 
specific
 
work tasks to
 
minimize exposure to workplace hazards.
All accidents, whether it involves a
 
minor or serious injury involving employees and guests,
 
must
 
be reported immediately
 
to your
 
manager. It
 
is only through
 
full knowledge
 
of every accident
 
that Chipotle can continue to better refine our processes and maintain a safe and healthy place for everyone to work.

ELECTRONIC
 
DEVICES
Excessive use of personal mobile or electronic devices ("mobile devices") during the workday can interfere with employee
 
productivity, impact food safety and be distracting

devices,
 
headphones,
 
and
 
ear

the privacy
 
and security
 
of your

also engaged in electronic monitoring. Chipotle's 
US Employee Privacy Policy
 
describes how Chipotle collects and uses personal information about you during and after your employment and further
 
describes Chipotle's electronic monitoring practices during your employment relationship with Chipotle.
The

the
 
categories
 
of
 
personal
 
information
 
that
 
we
 
collect,
 
how
 
we 
use your personal information, how we
 
secure your personal information, when we may disclose your 
personal

SOCIAL
 
MEDIA
We are dedicated
 
to
 
our
 
Food
 
With Integrity
 
mission and take pride in our commitment
 
to
 
using only real ingredients
 
in all of
 
our
 
recipes. One way to
 
share our
 
mission is through
 
social
 
media, influencers, and other online outlets. Chipotle's social media team is solely responsible for Chipotle's social media activity. You are not
 
authorized to speak or write on Chipotle's behalf, but
 
you may participate in Chipotle sponsored communications on platforms such as lnstagram or TikTok when requested and authorized by Chipotle's social media or communications team.
Social media is also a quick way for
 
you to connect
 
with friends and share information and personal opinions.
 
If
 
you
 
aren't
 
careful
 
and you
 
don't
 
think
 
things
 
through,
 
your
 
online
 
activity
 
can
 
also damage Chipotle's brand or spread misleading
 
or incomplete information about Chipotle. To avoid this, our Social Media Policy applies to all Chipotle employees. Chipotle will take all steps to stop unlawful and unethical acts (as defined in Chipotle's 
Code of Ethics)
 
and behavior and may take disciplinary
 
action, up to
 
and including
 
termination,
 
against
 
you if
 
you violate this policy or any other Chipotle policy, including Chipotle's
 
Code of
 
Ethics
,
 
through the use of
 
social media.
Employees are not
 
permitted to participate in
 
social media using their Chipotle email address. You should use only your personal email address for your social media accounts. Please remember
 
to protect yourself
 
and your
 
privacy
 
on social media. What you publish online is easy to
 
find and
 
will exist for a long time. Think before posting. You alone are personally responsible for your online 
activity.
Your social media activities (other than the requested and authorized use as described above) are outside the course and scope of your employment
 
with Chipotle. This means that you
 
may not
 
use Chipotle's computers, telephones,
 
or
 
equipment
 
for social media
 
when you are on working time, except
 
when requested
 
and authorized by Chipotle's social media or communications team. You may
