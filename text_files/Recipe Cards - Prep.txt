LIME JUICE
Did you know? Freshly squeezed lime juice is light
yellow to green and acidic with a zesty, tart citrus
taste. The flavor that the juice brings is unique
and can never be substituted in our recipes by
pasteurized citrus juice.
JUICE
1. Wash, rinse and sanitize hands. Put on disposable gloves.
2. Place lime half into squeezer with the peel side up.
3. Squeeze juice into a clean plastic deep 11⁄66 pan until it
no longer has any juice. Place the squeezed lime into
another empty deep 11⁄66 pan to dispose of when finished
juicing all limes.
4. Repeat for all limes.
5. Place stainless steel lid (with hole for ladle) on the plastic
deep 11⁄66 pan and label.
6. Place in ice bath in the walk-in until it reaches 41°F.
7. Store in grill reach-in for service.
NOTE:
To ensure lime juice stays within its SSL, lime juice
should only be prepared at 10am and 2pm. To help
prevent potential cross contamination, lime juice is
always prepared by a Focused Prep team member,
not a Grill team member.

RED ONIONS (DICED)
Did you know? Our red onions add a strong taste
