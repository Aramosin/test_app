ORIENTATION THE TRAINER’S GUIDE
If you’re looking at this guide, it’s because you’re training someone. As a
Certified Trainer, you’re training new hires or cross-training existing crew
members. As a leader, you are training new leaders. This guide exists to help
you teach any topic to your trainee so they can master their station or move
LINE
up in the Career Path. It will help you deliver the best training experience
possible. Remember, training at Chipotle is not just reading a book or showing
a video. Training at Chipotle is YOU getting in there with your trainee shoulder
to shoulder, introducing them to everything they need to know, letting them
shadow you while you teach, explaining best practices, giving them feedback as
CASH they perform a task, and validating that they can do it on their own.
I’m excited for you to be taking on this opportunity because you’ll be supporting
one of your fellow crew members and learning too by refreshing yourself on our
standards and building experience as a trainer. That’s why there’s much truth in
the saying, “When you teach one person, two people learn.”
DIGITAL This is the Trainer’s Guide.
Its purpose: to help trainers teach any topic any crew member or leader would
need to know to learn a new station or move up to the next level of the Career
Path. Trainers can be Certified Trainers if we’re talking about training new hires
or cross-training existing crew members, but they can also be leaders. After all,
leaders have to train their replacement before moving to the next level.
PREP
This guide doesn’t work on its own. It has to be used with Training Checklists,
which list the topics that a trainee needs to learn in order to be validated. For
each topic in the Training Checklist, there’s a topic in the Trainer’s Guide. The
trainer refers to the Trainer’s Guide to know exactly how to introduce the topic
and then how to work with the trainee through shadow and perform. It also
recommends specific validation questions that help the trainee prepare for their
GRILL
final knowledge check.
To navigate the Trainer’s Guide, select the tab for the position you’re training.
Then select the topic. You’ll see what your trainee will need to know and why it’s
important when you introduce the topic, followed by shadowing and performing
CERTIFIED instructions and some ways to validate knowledge. You can jump from topic to
TRAINER topic by selecting the tabs on the left, and you can print out a page or certain
activities if you need a paper copy for reference.
The Trainer’s Guide was created based on best practices from restaurants across
the company. It is updated regularly based on input from trainers like you. It is
meant to be followed as it is written to provide the highest levels of food quality,
KITCHEN
food safety, and learning. Therefore, deviating from the methods in this guide
LEADER
can put the guest experience and trainee experience at risk.
That being said, we appreciate feedback and your desire to improve upon our
methods. If you believe there is a better way than the one best way described in
this guide, share that with your Field Leader, who should contact your Regional
SERVICE Training Manager to discuss.
LEADER
Thank you and happy training,
Scott Boatwright — Chief Operating Officer

INTRODUCE
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
• Proper portions create the perfect flavor profile.
LINE
• Proper stacking makes the food look great and spreads ingredients evenly
over the entrée.
• Crew Pocket Guide includes all portion sizes with the utensils used for
portioning, as well as how to properly build each entrée for dine-in and
CASH to-go.
• Practice is the only way to perfect portioning; use a scale and an empty bowl.
• Never hold down on the tortilla press—it will rise when the tortilla soufflés.
• Entrées with extra meat are lead by a red tent. Entrées with queso blanco
are led by a yellow tent. Entrées with an LTO are lead by a white tent.
DIGITAL
• Finish entrées differently for dine-in or to-go (except burritos).
• Burritos are rolled tightly in a long cylinder. Burritos must never be
softball-shaped, and the tortilla must not tear or break.
BUILDING ENTRÉES COURSES
PREP • Teach how to make perfectly portioned entrées that also look great.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
• Proper portions and stacking ensure guests get a little bit of every
ingredient in each bite.
• Using the right portions every time creates consistency for our guests.
GRILL
• Holding down on the tortilla press dries the tortilla out, making it less
pliable and harder to roll.
• Beautiful food makes for a better guest experience.
• Finishing to-go entrées correctly ensures they don’t spill or leak.

ORIENTATION DAILY HACCP CONTROL LOG
INTRODUCE
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
• Also called the DHCL
LINE
• HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.
• A Hazard Analysis identifies potential food safety risks in the restaurant,
which leads to creating Critical Control Points (CCPs) to control those
hazards.
CASH
• We monitor CCPs every shift to keep the restaurant safe.
• The DHCL provides corrective actions that must be taken when there are
CCP failures.
• The Food Safety Leader (FSL), the senior leader on duty, is responsible for
making sure it is completed honestly and accurately every shift.
DIGITAL
• Crew can fill out sections of the DHCL but must be validated by FSL.
• Companion tool is the CCP1 Wellness Check Book, also called the Red
Book.
• All restaurant team members must sign the Red Book after they
individually receive a verbal and visual Wellness Check from the FSL

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
You’ve committed to becoming a Kitchen Leader, you’ve completed a

food FACT tasting with your Field Leader as part of your commitment
meeting, and you understand the role of the KL. Now what? It’s time to
start training.
The goal will be to introduce, shadow, and perform each topic and to
CASH complete each activity listed in the KLT checklist. After that, the trainer
will validate each topic as recommended by the Trainer’s Guide. When you
complete all topics and activities, you’ll take a knowledge check. Based on
your score, your performance, and your final food FACT tasting validation
back to your Field Leader, you, your trainer, your GM/R/CTM, and your Field
Leader will all sign off that you are ready.
DIGITAL
To achieve this goal, you will need to work with your trainer in person. So,
before you begin, you’ll work with your trainer to determine the best times
to work together. Compare schedules for the week ahead and see where
they overlap. After you figure out when you’ll be working together, plan
out which topics you can cover. If you do not think your schedules overlap
PREP
enough to cover the material, talk to your leader to make changes to the
schedule so you have more time to train.
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:
You cannot train without your trainer. By looking at your schedules and
GRILL knowing when you will be working together, you’ll be able to plan exactly
how you would like to spend your time.
If you do not manage your time with your trainer, you will take too long to

practices and procedures in the back of house from the moment food
enters the restaurant as part of a delivery, through storage in the walk-in,
and finally during prep and cooking.
The KL is expected to set an example for food safety procedures, which
CASH include following cleaning and maintenance cards and recipe cards
exactly as they are written since they are written to reduce risk of
foodborne illness.
The KL is expected to identify and correct all behaviors in the back of house

DIGITAL
Failure to set a good example or identify and correct poor food safety
practices sends the message that those practices are not important and

Proper maintenance of our BOH kitchen equipment and facilities affects
food safety proactively by making sure our equipment is still in good

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:
The best food safety practices—and the training and focus that make them a

Most of our food safety intervention and control points take place in the

CCP stands for Critical Control Points. Based on the Hazard Analysis, a CCP is
CASH
created to control the hazards in the restaurant that present the biggest food
safety risks, so it’s critical to monitor and control them to keep the restaurant
safe. If there are any CCP failures, then corrective action(s) must be taken to
ensure adulterated or contaminated product is never served to our guests.
The FSL is the senior leader on duty at any given moment. As a KL, you may
DIGITAL
be scheduled as a FSL at opening. Because many of the critical control points
(CCPs) live entirely within the back of house, your FSL may delegate much of
the responsibility of filling out certain sections to you.
You’ll need to be familiar with not just the CCPs within your BOH
responsibilities, but also the corrective actions you’ll need to take in the
PREP
event of any CCP failures. These corrective actions are listed in the DHCL for
your reference.
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:
The Daily HACCP Control Log (DHCL) ensures that every restaurant has
GRILL excellent food safety practices.
Most of our food safety intervention and control points take place in the
back of house. Proper food safety practices and procedures in the back of
house are where we have the most control over the safety of the food we

ORIENTATION FOOD QUALITY
INTRODUCE
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
It’s part of the role of the Kitchen Leader to ensure the quality of all food,
LINE including the freshness of raw and prepped ingredients. This begins at the
moment the food arrives as part of a food order.
When your food orders arrive, you must make sure they are accurate and
the quality of every item meets our standards.
CASH
INSPECT IT
• Check that all boxes are in good condition (not crushed, bulging, broken, wet, etc.).
» If boxes are damaged, the food might be damaged, too. Check the
contents of the box to make sure.
DIGITAL
» If there is damage to the food in the case, please submit a food quality
report using the FQRSMobile app on your Traceability Scanner.
• Check fruits and vegetables for freshness (for example, ripeness of avocados).
• Check dry goods and refrigerated goods for dampness, punctures, tears, or odor.
PREP COUNT IT
• Verify that the number of items you receive matches the number of items
you ordered. If the order is delivered before anyone is in the restaurant,
it must be counted immediately. If the order is delivered while there are
people in the restaurant, the order must be counted and the invoice must
be signed by the leader on duty before the driver leaves.
GRILL
• Make note of all missing items. You do not want to be charged for
something you didn’t receive. Also make note of all extra items received.

ORIENTATION FOOD FACT TASTING
INTRODUCE
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
The Kitchen Leader ensures all food looks and tastes delicious. This is
LINE
done by tasting food critically for flavor & aroma and texture & mouth feel
and by making sure the appearance and color of food follows standards.
FACT is an acronym used to describe the 4 tasting quality standards for
each food item:
CASH
 F stands for Flavor & Aroma
 A stands for Appearance
 C stands for Color
 T stands for Texture & Mouth Feel
DIGITAL
The FACT standards for each food item can be found on the Recipe Card,
since tasting is a step written into each recipe to make sure the food item
meets our standards as it’s prepared. To ensure that all food looks and
tastes delicious to every single guest throughout the entire day, food
FACT tastings are also completed at 4 scheduled times throughout the

day.
No food can go out without you checking it and tasting it. As the KL, you

FOOD FACT RESPONSE GUIDE
For any food item that doesn’t meet a certain standard of FACT, you need
to work with your team to fix it. The exact steps will vary depending on the
food item and the standard missed. The Food FACT Response Guide, located
LINE
on the back of each Food FACT Tasting Sheet, is used for this.
Sometimes adjustments can be made on the spot to improve the quality
of the food so it can be served to guests. But sometimes the food has
serious issues and no adjustments can be made to the food to bring it up
CASH
to a quality that can be served to our guests. If this is the case, the right
thing to do for our guests is to replace, retrain and make it fresh. That’s why
following the Food FACT Response Guide is so important.
A few common examples include:
DIGITAL • Reseason & Retrain: The standard for flavor & aroma for steak is fresh
beef steak flavor with medium back palate heat from the adobo marinade
and distinctive salt flavor. If you’re tasting steak and find that it doesn’t
have a distinctive salt flavor, that means enough salt isn’t being added or
it’s not being added at the right time. Work with your Grill team to make
new steak, while you make sure that they’re salting the steak as soon as
PREP they lay it on the grill and that they’re sprinkling the steak with a light,
even layer of salt.
• Remove & Report: The standard for texture & mouth feel for pinto beans
is soft and tender. If you taste pinto beans that have a very hard texture,
Remove & Report. Since these pinto beans cannot be served and you
GRILL cannot fix the issue in the restaurant, remove them and complete a Food
Quality Report. This is why we taste every batch before it hits the line.
• Replace & Retrain: The standard for color for fajitas is mix of green and
purple with evenly caramelized edges. The standard for texture & mouth
feel is crisp with slight crunch, not raw, soggy, or limp. If you find the
CERTIFIED
fajitas Color is not to standard since you don’t see any caramelization

KITCHEN
fajita mix evenly across the grill. When retraining, always use your tools
LEADER
and always retaste the final product to ensure the new bath has met all
Food FACT standards.
• Replace & Retrain: The standard for texture & mouth feel for brown rice
is light, fluffy and tender, not sticky, chewy or crunchy. If you’re tasting
SERVICE
brown rice and find that it’s crunchy, that means it hasn’t been cooked

ORIENTATION PREP SHEET
INTRODUCE
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
The Prep Sheet is a tool that calculates how much food you need to prepare
LINE
for the day. It calculates these amounts using the forecasted sales (anticipated
sales that are projected for the day) and the usage per thousand (also known as
UPT: how much of each item the restaurant goes through per $1000 in sales).
In the upper left-hand section of the Prep Sheet are the projected sales for the
day, followed by the sales projected for the AM shift (open – 3:00pm) and the
CASH
PM shift (3:00pm to close). Projected sales are one of the major factors that
determine how much food to prepare. If the restaurant’s actual sales are much
higher than the projected sales, you run the risk of running out of food. If the
actual sales are lower than the projected sales, you run the risk of over prepping
and wasting food. It is critical that we have every ingredient available for our
DIGITAL guests at all times.
The tool is divided into columns and rows. The columns are labeled Needs, On
Hand, and AM or PM Prep. The needs are calculated automatically, and when
combined with the units in the “Prep Unit” column, they tell us exactly how
much prep we’ll need to get through the shift or day. For example, if the AM
PREP Needs for medium corn salsa is 19.92, and the prep amount for medium corn
salsa is 1/6 pans, we know we’ll need 19.92 1/6 pans of corn salsa to get through
today.
Next to the Needs column is an On Hand column, where we write how much
of that prepared food item we have that can be served to guests. This is not
GRILL calculated automatically. The Kitchen Leader must count the inventory and
enter it here. Pay special attention to Secondary Shelf Lives (SSLs) and only
count food that is not expired. Specifically, adhere to these guidelines:
• Lettuce – ONLY hold overnight if the SSL is not expired, there is no
CERTIFIED browning present. There should be a note on the previous day’s Prep Sheet
TRAINER that lettuce was prepped on the PM shift.
• Cut Limes – NEVER hold overnight.
• Onions and Cilantro – NEVER hold overnight. Opening
on-hand counts should be 0. Enter needs into PDT to find accurate quantity
KITCHEN needed. Write those numbers in the PREP column.
LEADER
• Cheese – Shred in the AM as part of Focused Prep. There shouldn’t be
more than 4 pans held overnight. If more than 4, note why.
• Guacamole – NEVER hold overnight guacamole that was placed on the line
for service. Guacamole can be held overnight if SSL is NOT expired, and it
SERVICE was NOT placed on the line for service.
LEADER
• Mild Salsa – NEVER hold overnight.
• Vinaigrette - While this item has an overnight hold, if it does not meet

Subtract the On Hand amount from the amount in the Needs column to
calculate how much to prepare in the morning. For example, if this same
restaurant had two 1/6 pans of corn leftover from the night before, the AM
PREP prep for corn salsa is only 17.92 1/6 pans of corn because two pans are already
finished. Always round up to the nearest number that makes sense. For
instance, round 17.92 up to 18.

RAW ITEM NEEDS ON HAND = TOTAL

For some items, it might make sense to round to the nearest decimal.
For instance, for washed and rinsed lettuce, round 2.08 up to 2.25, not 3.
Consider our recipes when determining PREP amounts. For example:
• Corn Salsa – Prep in EVEN quantities (8, 10, 12, etc.).
CERTIFIED
TRAINER
• Green Salsa, Hot Salsa, and Sour Cream – ONLY prep what is needed.
Just because it’s easy to prepare doesn’t mean you should make more

Example: sales tomorrow = $10,000, wash and blanch 10 pounds.
• Steak – Can be prepped in increments of 2 (2,4,6,8, etc.). Steak should

The 3:00pm process of comparing the AM forecast sales to actual sales,
as well as completing the On Hand count for the PM shift is called a “Gut
Check”. This tells us if we’re on track for the day or if we have to adjust our
LINE plan. If actual sales are much higher or lower than forecasted, work with your
leader to reproject, and reprint the prep sheet to ensure every guest who
comes in for dinner can get exactly what they want. Once the AM forecasted
sales have been validated and the PM On Hand count has been completed,
subtract the On Hand amount from the amount in the Needs column to
CASH calculate any items that need to be prepared for the PM shift.
The closing leader will write the actual sales, time, and their initials above the
FORECAST SALES at the end of the day. They will also check the walk-in and
reach-ins to discard or donate any items that will expire before we open for
business the next day. If the night shift needs to prep additional items, they

ORIENTATION COOKING TO NEEDS TOOL
INTRODUCE
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
Cooking to Needs simply means cooking the right amount of food for
LINE
each part of the day. The Cooking to Needs Tool can help achieve this by
comparing hourly sales trend data to the usage of each hot food item.
Using this information, the tool then calculates how much food Grill should
cook for a specific period of the day (broken down by hour).
CASH You can access the Cooking to Needs Tool on Chiplinks. Within the Cooking
to Needs Tool are two separate tabs - one for the AM Shift and one for the
PM shift. Within each of these tabs, each hour’s sales projection is shown
along with the quantity of each hot food item that should be cooked for
that hour. Catering orders will also be incorporated by adding in the hot
food quantities for each order into the corresponding hour. These figures
DIGITAL
are estimates, and there can be some variation if the actual sales are
different from the projected sales.
During any given time interval, the KL and Grill team use the Tool to plan
and prepare for the shift by making sure the needs for each food item are
fulfilled before the corresponding time interval begins. In other words,
PREP
when a given time interval begins, the grill team should have all of the food
items listed under that time interval cooked. These food items can be on
the front line, digital make line, or in the hotbox. Thus, the team has to work
backwards to determine when to start cooking. For example, if the Cooking
to Needs Tool told us we needed one deep 1/3 pan of chicken at 2PM and
GRILL chicken takes 20 minutes to cook and cut, we’d start cooking the chicken
at 1:40PM to make sure we have enough for the guests we are expecting
to come in during the hour starting at 2PM. If you do not cook the
recommended amount of food on time, your restaurant will likely run out of
that item if the sales for that hour meet or exceed the predicted sales for
CERTIFIED
that hour. On the other hand, if too much food is cooked, it will likely carry
TRAINER
over into the next hour, which means it won’t look or taste as fresh and will
lead to food waste later in the day.

ORIENTATION FOOD WITH INTEGRITY
INTRODUCE
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
Food With Integrity (FWI) is Chipotle’s commitment to finding the very
LINE
best ingredients raised with respect for the animals, the environment, and
the farmers.
Chipotle is the only national restaurant brand that prepares food without
added flavors, colors, or preservatives. All of the wholesome food served at
CASH Chipotle is made from a short list of 53 real ingredients.
Here are some important terms used to describe our food:
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:
DIGITAL • Responsibly Raised meats: Chipotle believes animals should be
Responsibly Raised. This means that they’re treated humanely and with
respect from birth to slaughter, fed a vegetarian diet, and never given
hormones or antibiotics. Chipotle buys more Responsibly Raised meat
than any other restaurant in the United States.
• rBGH: rBGH stands for Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone. It’s a synthetic
PREP
growth hormone that causes dairy cattle to produce more milk, but it can
also cause joint problems and udder infections. We never want animals to be
in pain, which is why 100% of the milk in our sour cream, cheese, and queso
blanco comes from cows that have never been treated with rBGH .
• Pasture Raised: Chipotle also believes dairy cows should be pasture
GRILL
raised. This means they’re given daily access to outdoor pastures, never
given added hormones, and are fed an all-vegetarian diet. 100% of our
sour cream and a large percentage of our cheese comes from pasture
raised dairy cows. We’re working hard to increase the percentage of our
pasture raised cheese.
CERTIFIED
TRAINER • Organic: We believe produce should be grown organically. Organic means
grown without the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or weed killers.
This is better for the produce and the long-term health of the soil. A good
percentage of our beans are organically grown. Our goal is 100%, but it
will take some time due to limited supply.
KITCHEN
LEADER • Local: We believe the less distance food has to travel, the better. Sourcing
local food reduces food miles, supports rural economies, and ensures
fresh, great-tasting seasonal produce. Local means within 350 miles from
our restaurants. The amount and type of food bought locally depends on
the growing season. We serve millions of pounds of locally grown produce
SERVICE
and are the only national restaurant committed to buying local on a
LEADER
significant scale.
• Farmers: We respect the farmers who raise their animals and crops
naturally with respect for the long-term health of the land and
community. We support those farmers by buying from them instead of
APPRENTICE
larger farms and food distributors.
Continued on the next page ¬

Page 243:
ORIENTATION FOOD WITH INTEGRITY CONTINUED
• People: We believe it’s important for people to know where their food comes
from. We continually look for the best ingredients from the best sources. We
give guests higher-quality food that tastes better and keeps them coming back.
LINE
• GMOs: GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism, which is a plant
or animal created by inserting genes from one species (typically bacteria
or a virus) into the DNA of another to achieve characteristics that would
not occur naturally. In 2015, Chipotle became the first national restaurant
company to cook only with non-GMO ingredients. While all of the ingredients

in our food are non-GMO, some of the beverages served contain GMOs

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:
DIGITAL Food With Integrity and Real Ingredients are what set us apart from the
competition. Our commitment to sourcing responsibly and creating simple,
wholesome food is a big reason many of our guests choose to eat at our
restaurants.
Understanding the quality of our food helps us appreciate its value. It

Listed in the Leader Pocket Guide are all standards for the back of house.
LINE
The standards are divided by area and include dish/chemical, storage/walk-

the Kitchen Leader.
These standards are not negotiable. When the standards are not being met,
CASH the Kitchen Leader is responsible for correcting it.
[Review the Leader Pocket Guide BOH Standards section with the trainee]
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:
Our standards keep our guests and our teams safe while contributing to an
DIGITAL excellent guest experience. Allowing the back of house to operate below the
standard will put our teams, our guests, and our business at risk.
When we walk past the something that is below the standard and we do
nothing about it, we set a newer, lower standard.
PREP SHADOW
The trainer and trainee will walk through the back of house together. The
trainee will read the standards from the Leader Pocket Guide. At that time,
the trainer should evaluate whether the standard is met or not. If it is, the
trainee should check it off in the Leader Pocket Guide. If it is not, the trainer
GRILL should demonstrate the corrective action necessary, whether it be cleaning,
maintenance, providing feedback to the crew, or a combination thereof.

ORIENTATION HOSPITALITY
INTRODUCE
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
The Kitchen Leader plays a big role in hospitality, even if they have less
LINE
direct interaction with the guest than positions in the front of house do.
The back of house can support Be & Look Your Best by keeping the kitchen
clean and shiny and by smiling and making eye contact with the rest of the
team.
CASH
A Prep and Grill team that is Guest Obsessed will review sales projections
and usage to anticipate the amount of food to prepare and cook so guests
never have to wait and always have fresh food. Prep and Grill may also help
satisfy special requests such as rice without cilantro. If so, the standard
applies that they must customize with a smile.
DIGITAL
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:
The back of house is in view of the guests, so the appearance and behavior
of the back-of-house team has a direct impact on the guest experience.
Smiles are contagious. When the back-of-house team is smiling, the team
PREP serving guests on the line will be smiling too.
SHADOW
The trainer will demonstrate how to communicate with the team on the front
line by smiling, making eye contact, and speaking with clarity and energy.
GRILL
The trainer and trainee will walk into the dining room and look into the
restaurant’s open kitchen from the guest perspective. The trainer will point
out what the guest can see and how having a clean and shiny workstation
and personal appearance will improve the guest experience.
CERTIFIED
TRAINER PERFORM
The trainee will communicate with the team on the front line by smiling,
making eye contact, and speaking with clarity and energy. The trainee can
perform this, for example, by asking Tortilla if they need any rice, beans, or
meats.

The trainee will keep a clean and shiny workstation and personal

VALIDATE
SERVICE The trainee will explain what it means to Be & Look Your Best in the back of
LEADER house and why it’s important to the guest experience.
The trainee will explain what it means to Be Guest Obsessed as a Kitchen
Leader. For example, they might explain how prepping and cooking the right
amount of food is a form of anticipating needs or how important it is to
APPRENTICE customize with a smile.

ORIENTATION FEEDBACK
INTRODUCE
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Prepping and cooking safe food that looks and tastes delicious and making
LINE
sure there is enough of it for every part of the day will only happen if you
lead by providing useful feedback to your team.
Now that you understand what the Back of House Standards are, you’ll be
responsible for holding people to those standards by providing feedback.
CASH
Feedback can either be positive or corrective. When you offer positive
feedback, you are reinforcing something that was done right. When you
offer corrective feedback, you are discouraging a behavior. You should
recommend an alternative.
There are four guidelines to giving good feedback. They are:
DIGITAL
Do it now – You only have a moment to give feedback when you notice it.
When you observe something that is not up to our standards, mention it
right away. If you do not, you may forget to mention it entirely. You may
also find it harder to bring it up later because it may seem irrelevant or
useless now that the moment has passed. You also risk setting a newer,
PREP
lower standards for the team.
Do it often - Giving useful feedback is a habit, and like any habit, you
must practice it. As you practice it, it will get easier and easier for you to
give feedback
GRILL
Be specific – be clear about exactly what the trainee is doing correctly
or exactly what the trainee needs to change. It gives your trainee better
direction and improves your results. It gives you an opportunity to reinforce
exactly what the standard is and lets your trainee know how they are
performing against that standard.
CERTIFIED
TRAINER
Be sincere – Really mean it. Let the other person know it comes from a
good place and you are hoping to help them improve.
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT
KITCHEN When your team does not receive feedback, they are unaware of how they
LEADER are performing against the standard.
If you observe a team member doing something incorrectly and you do not
say something, you are silently approving a newer, lower standard.
SERVICE
SHADOW
LEADER
The trainer will demonstrate giving feedback to the trainee. The trainer
and trainee will go to a handwashing sink together. The trainee will wash
their hands but make an obvious and observable mistake like washing for
too short a time or not using soap. The trainer will use this opportunity to
demonstrate how to give feedback.

The trainer and trainee will switch places. The trainer will wash their hands

ORIENTATION BOH FACILITIES CHECKLIST
INTRODUCE
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
The back of house has lots of equipment that needs to be cleaned
LINE
and maintained to function properly so the team can work efficiently.
As a Kitchen Leader, it’s your responsibility to take ownership of this
equipment.
Your Facilities Specialist (FS), a member of the support staff who works
CASH with your GM/R/CTM to keep your equipment and restaurant in top
condition, conducts a quarterly preventative maintenance (PM) audit that
surveys the condition of your restaurant.
ServiceChannel is the system we use to report facilities issues and
request help when equipment is not functioning properly. You can find it
DIGITAL on Chiplinks on the BOH computer.
You can find videos for simple and common repairs by watching the
Cleaning and Maintenance Cards on the Spice Hub.
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT
PREP Routine preventative maintenance is easier, cheaper, and less disruptive than
fixing or replacing something that has broken because of lack of care.
If a piece of equipment isn’t running smoothly or breaks, it can slow down
the team and affect the guest experience. Some equipment, like the walk-
in cooler for example, is so critical that a malfunction might even shut
GRILL
down the entire restaurant.

the checklist with your trainer under the Kitchen Hot Line and BOH sections.

ORIENTATION LEADING THE SHIFT
INTRODUCE
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
When you lead the shift, you want to create an excellent experience for each
LINE
guest. In order to do that, you must be able to answer “yes” to the following
three questions:
1. Do I have accurate sales projections?
2. Do I have the right amount of food?
CASH
3. Do I have the right number of people?
Sales projections—predictions for the total revenue you will generate based
on historical trends, weather, and local events—are the single factor that
DIGITAL determines how much food you need and how many people you need to run a
great shift.
So when you are evaluating your sales projections, take time to make sure that
they are thoughtful by doing the following:
PREP
• Consider the weather, school schedule, or local events that will impact
restaurant business.
• Check Aloha Takeout, Catering Order Manager, and Dear Diary for large
orders that will affect your projections for the day.
GRILL
Find your projected sales on the prep sheet and on the schedule. Check
that the projected sales on the prep sheet match the projected sales on the
schedule.

PREP
After you check your sales projections, making any necessary adjustments to
the prep sheet and schedule, ask yourself if you will have enough food and if
you will have enough labor to provide an excellent guest experience.
GRILL
Having the right amount of food:
• Check with the Kitchen Leader to make sure the team is prepping enough
food for the shift.
• If you do not have enough food in the restaurant, call your GM/R/CTM or
CERTIFIED
Field Leader or call the closest restaurant for help.
TRAINER
• If your sales projections are accurate and you are still prepping too much
or not enough food, tell your AP or GM/R/CTM and figure out why.
KITCHEN Having the right number of people:
LEADER
• The schedule can tell you how many people you have scheduled
compared to how many people are recommended. At the bottom of
the schedule Peak Lunch or Peak Dinner (sch/rec) means scheduled /
recommended. In the previous schedule, you’ll see 7/8 highlighted in
SERVICE orange, which means this restaurant is understaffed for the shift.
LEADER
• If you don’t have enough people scheduled, try to call someone in to help.
If you can’t find someone, call your Field Leader and ask for assistance.
They may be able to find someone from another restaurant to help.
APPRENTICE
Continued on the next page ¬

Page 303:
ORIENTATION LEADING THE SHIFT CONTINUED
ADJUSTING LABOR BASED ON CHANGING SALES PROJECTIONS:
A good guideline to follow is every $100 in sales equals one hour of labor. Here
are some examples that show you how to use this:
LINE
• If you projected your sales to be $4,000, and you had a last minute
catering order for $500, your new sales projection would be $4,500.
That equals five hours of labor for the day, which means you could call in
someone to work for five hours to help out.
CASH
• If you projected your sales to be $4,000 and, as the day continues, you
notice it is slow, your new sales projection could be $3,500. That equals
five hours of labor for the day, which means you would want to ask some
people to go home early so you could save on labor.

At the end of each peak, compare the sales and transactions for the peak

LINE
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Accurate sales projections and having the right amount of food and labor are the
foundation to having an excellent guest experience and setting up your team for
a successful shift.
CASH
If your sales projection is high, you’ll have leftover food on the line and in the
walk-in and extra crew members standing around with little to do, costing the
business money.
If your sales projection is low, you’ll run out of food, slow down throughput,
overwork your crew, and have a dirty restaurant with a poor guest experience.

ORIENTATION SCHEDULE WRITING
INTRODUCE
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
A major expectation of the Apprentice is to schedule your team
LINE
appropriately. That means writing the schedule for the week.
The number of people you schedule is based on the sales you project. If
you think you’ll have higher sales, you’ll schedule more people. If you think
you’ll have lower sales, you’ll schedule fewer people. Sales projections are
CASH covered in detail in the next week of training.
After completing the ChipForce training, you’ll evaluate the execution of
previous schedules using the Labor – Schedule Check report, then start
writing your own with your trainer.
DIGITAL WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
A great schedule is the foundation for success in the coming week. It’s a
plan that will help organize your team and set you up to have the right
amount of people to execute every day.
Writing a schedule forces you to think about everything coming up in the
PREP week ahead, including weather, special events, fundraisers, promo days, and
catering orders. The exercise of schedule writing keeps you one step ahead
and helps you lead the team because you know what to expect and you
have a plan.
It’s important to use the Labor – Schedule Check because it can show you
GRILL
what opportunities you have to improve in your scheduling and planning for
the week ahead. For example if you find you are exceeding the number of
hours allotted to you by the Labor Matrix, you could think about scheduling
differently to more accurately achieve your recommended Labor Matrix
hours.

• Start with scheduling of the leadership team before discussing scheduling
crew.
• Show how your schedule is able to cover all 14 day parts during the week and
cover the opening and closing of the restaurant.
• Then incorporate crew into your schedule.

If you receive feedback from your Field Leader, review feedback from the Field
Leader with your trainee and incorporate it together.
Then, post the schedule for next week with your trainee.
DO NOT simply copy the schedule from the previous week and make small

ORIENTATION DEPLOYMENT TOOL
INTRODUCE
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
As a Service Leader, you learned what the Deployment Tool is, why it’s
LINE
important, and how to fill one out before the shift using information from
the schedule and the prep sheet to ensure that prep is completed on time
and that the team is in position before the peak to provide an excellent
guest experience.
CASH The Deployment Tool is a great source of information for you to dig into
what’s happening with the schedule. A review of the tool will indicate to
you whether or not the team is scheduled to complete all prep before peak
service times
The Deployment Tool is a plan to execute great throughput. All Five
DIGITAL Pillars are on the Deployment Tool. Here is how you can check to see if
the Deployment Tool has been set up for Five Pillars execution and great
throughput:
ACES in PLACES is determined by the putting the best person for each
position that is needed based on the projected sales. Also, the tool has all of
PREP the correct positions on the Deployment Tool which is based on the number
of people needed. Finally, the Deployment Tool lets the team know when
they need to be deployed for the peak period so that we have everyone
deployed for an excellent guest experience.
One of the biggest pieces of MISE EN PLACE is all of the prep that is done
GRILL
in the morning. The Deployment Tool outlines who will be doing what
prep and when that prep needs to be done, which sets us up to deliver an
excellent guest experience.
You can evaluate that the LINEBACKER is the right person. For all
CERTIFIED deployments with 8 people or more the Linebacker is in RED. This means
TRAINER
that the leader on duty should be deployed to Linebacker during the peak
period.
Finally, you can evaluate the EXPO. For deployments with 5-7 people the
expo is in RED. This means that the leader on duty should be deployed to
KITCHEN
expo during the peak period.
LEADER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
At the Apprentice level, you may not always complete the Deployment Tool,
especially if your SL opens the restaurant for you and you come in on a
SERVICE mid-shift, so it’s helpful to know how to review the Deployment Tool.

ORIENTATION HOSPITALITY
INTRODUCE
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
Part of the role of the Apprentice is providing an excellent guest
LINE
experience, which includes great Food, Feel, and Flow. Hospitality is all
about how we make our guests Feel.
Training every team member effectively in hospitality means you will need
to recognize and reward hospitable behavior when you see it. Celebrate
CASH team members who exhibit the four Cornerstones.
Team members need to understand that their role is ultimately about
satisfying the guest. It is most effective for leadership to model this
behavior and talk about the guest often.
Leaders must emphasize the importance of repeat business and the
DIGITAL
frequency of guests visiting the restaurant so the investment in hospitality
generates a real return in sales.
The Apprentice or General Manager must have plenty of real-life practice
using the BLAST model to recover guests.
PREP
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
The leadership models the behavior in the restaurant and sets the
priorities. If leadership puts the guest first, the entire team will put the
guest first.

hands of the Apprentice or General Manager.

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
The best thing you can do to build sales is consistently provide an excellent

guest experience. If you start with that, you can accelerate building sales by
doing the following:
1. Valuing your guests: When you value your guests, you build trust,
loyalty, and connection and you get them to come more frequently.
CASH
2. Partnering with your guests: When you partner with your guests, you

VALUING YOUR GUESTS
You can show your guests that you value them by:
• Showing appreciation: Tell them directly by saying thank you
SERVICE
LEADER • Give our guests something we know they will love — FREE FOOD: Most
of our guests are not expecting this from us, so when we give it to them,

USING MANAGER COMP
You are not the only person who can use a manager comp to wow a guest
by giving away food for free. Your cashiers can do it too. They can run a
LINE manager comp without a leader swipe, but they will need you to sign off on
the receipt. But first, make sure that you have a conversation with them to
explain how to do it, why we do it, and why it’s important.
A few tips for making the most of your manager comp include:
CASH
• Use it for first-time guests. It makes quite a first impression.
• Use it for loyal guests. It shows that you recognize and appreciate their
business.
• Tell them why you are giving them something for free. If you don’t, the
guest could be confused or expect something for free every visit.
DIGITAL
• Use it to make an excellent experience even more excellent.
• Keep manager comps under control. Do not exceed your budget.
• Do not use manager comp to give free food to friends and family. Chances
are they know about us already and love it as much as you do.

PARTNERING WITH YOUR GUESTS
We have very effective marketing tools that give you an opportunity to reach
