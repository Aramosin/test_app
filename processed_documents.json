This Handbook is designed to tell you about Chipotle and its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Chipotle\" or the \"Company\") and provide answers to many of your questions regarding your employment with us. The contents of this Handbook are only a summary of the employee benefits, practices, and policies in effect at the time of publication. Chipotle retains the right to add, modify, or delete policies, benefits, wages, and all other working conditions as it deems appropriate without obtaining another person's consent or agreement. Therefore, other than the at-will agreement contained in the Employee Acknowledgment and Agreement at the end of this Handbook, this Handbook should not be construed as creating any kind of \"employment contract.\" As provided in the Employee Acknowledgment and Agreement, employment at Chipotle is at-will and may be terminated by either you or Chipotle, with or without cause or prior notice. This Handbook supersedes any and all prior Handbooks, written documents or oral representations that contradict the at-will nature of your employment. Your status as an \"at-will\" employee may not be changed except in writing signed by the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of Chipotle. We encourage you to discuss any questions or concerns regarding this Handbook or any work­ related issues with us. We cannot address any of your questions or concerns unless we know about them. If you have a problem, please speak with your immediate manager as soon as possible. They are responsible for what takes place in your immediate work area and may be in the best position to help you. If you prefer not to speak with your immediate manager, or if you feel your immediate manager cannot or has not satisfactorily resolved the issue, contact your HR Business Partner if you are in the Restaurant Support Center (\"RSC\") or the Respectful Workplace Hotline (\"RWH\") Team if you are in a restaurant. You can also make an anonymous complaint by calling the Chipotle hotline at 1-866-755- 4449 or visiting www.chipotleconfidential.com . You are encouraged to utilize this procedure without fear of retaliation. If you have a complaint of harassment or discrimination, or you require a reasonable accommodation, please refer to the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, the Policy Against Unlawful Harassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation, or the Reasonable Accommodations Policies in this Handbook. Chipotle takes all employee concerns and problems seriously. We will work to address your concern and/or resolve your problem as soon as possible. You are encouraged to bring concerns to our attention using any of the methods described above without fear of retaliation. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard to race (including traits historically associated with race, such as hair texture and protective hairstyles, including braids, locks, and twists), ethnicity, religion, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), color, caste, sex (including childbirth, breast feeding, sex­ based stereotypes, and related medical conditions), gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, uniform service member and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, age (40 and over), protected medical condition (including cancer and genetic conditions), genetic information, disability (mental and physical), reproductive health decision-making, medical leave or other types of protected leave, domestic violence victim status, political affiliation, or any other protected status in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Our policy extends to all aspects of our employment practices, including but not limited to recruiting, hiring, discipline, termination, promotions, transfers, compensation, benefits, training, leaves of absence, and other terms and conditions of employment. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS DISABILITY AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND PRACTICES ACCOMODATIONS Chipotle is committed to complying with all laws protecting qualified individuals with disabilities, as well as employees' religious beliefs and practices. Our .QQJ.i.g,l extends to all aspects of our employment practices, including but not limited to, recruiting, hiring, discipline, termination, promotions, transfers, compensation, benefits, training, leaves of absence, and other terms and conditions of employment. Chipotle will provide a reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals' known physical or mental disability and/or employees' religious beliefs and practices, provided the requested accommodation does not create an undue hardship for Chipotle and/or does not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace and/or to the individual. If you require an accommodation to perform the essential functions of your job, contact The Hartford Disability and Absence Management by calling (888)277-4767, or visiting www.thehartford.com/mybenefits . If you require an accommodation for a personal medical reason or religious beliefs or practices, contact your manager or HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, or the Accommodations Analyst at accommodations@chipotle.com if you are in the restaurants. Once Chipotle is aware of the need for an accommodation, Chipotle will engage in an interactive process to identify possible accommodations. If you believe that you have been treated in a manner not in accordance with these policies, please notify us immediately as indicated above in the \"When You Have Questions\" section. You are encouraged to utilize these procedures without fear of retaliation. LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS Chipotle strives to provide a supportive work environment to enable all nursing employees to express milk during working hours in accordance with applicable law. Lactation Break. Chipotle will provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate an employee's desire to express breast milk for the employee's child, for up to one (1) year of age, except where state or local law requires a more extended period. If possible, the employee should take their lactation breaks during rest breaks and/or meal periods already provided. Hourly employees should clock out for additional lactation breaks that do not run concurrently with normally scheduled meal and/or rest periods. Break times will only be paid where required by law. Lactation Location. Chipotle will provide a lactation location (the \"Lactation Location\"), other than a bathroom, in close proximity to the employee's work area that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public while the employee is expressing milk. The Lactation Location may be the place where the employee normally works if it otherwise meets the requirements of this policy. Requests for Lactation Accommodation. Employees have a right to request lactation accommodation, which includes lactation breaks and a Lactation Location as discussed above. To request lactation accommodation, obtain a Lactation Accommodation Request Form from either your manager or Chiplinks and submit the completed form to both your manager and benefits@chipotle.com . We will promptly respond to a request for lactation accommodation and will engage in an interactive process to determine the appropriate lactation break periods and Lactation Location. Retaliation Prohibited. Chipotle has a zero-tolerance policy against retaliation for any reason. Retaliation against an employee for exercising any rights under this policy or applicable law is prohibited. Conflict with Applicable Law. If any portion of this policy conflicts with any applicable provision of federal, state, or local law, then such provision of law shall control, and the conflicting portion of the policy will be void. PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS Chipotle will provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees for known limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions of a qualified employee. If you require an accommodation to perform the essential functions of your job for known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, please notify your manager or HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, or the RWH Team if you are in the restaurants at respectful@chipotle.com . Once we are aware of the need for an accommodation, we will engage in an interactive process to identify possible accommodations. If Chipotle determines that all other reasonable accommodations create an undue hardship for the Company and/or pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace and/or to the individual, Chipotle may require you to take a leave of absence, subject to the provision of medical documentation of your need. If you do not have available leave or do not qualify for any state or federal protected leaves, Chipotle will provide a leave of absence to the extent leave is otherwise provided to eligible employees. If you believe that you have been treated in a manner not in accordance with these policies, please notify Chipotle immediately by speaking to your HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, or the RWH Team if you are in the restaurants at respectful@chipotle.com . You are encouraged to utilize this procedure without fear of retaliation. POLICY AGAINST UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION Chipotle is committed to providing a work environment that is free of unlawful harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. Chipotle strictly prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination and harassment, including: discrimination or harassment on the basis of race (including traits historically associated with race, such as hair texture and protective hairstyles, including braids, locks, and twists), ethnicity, religion, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), color, caste, sex (including childbirth, breast feeding, sex-based stereotypes, and related medical conditions), gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, uniform service member and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, age (40 and over), protected medical condition (including cancer and genetic conditions), genetic information, disability (mental and physical), reproductive health decision-making, medical leave or other types of protected leave, domestic violence victim status, political affiliation, or any other category protected by applicable federal, state, or local law. Chipotle's policy against unlawful harassment, discrimination, and retaliation applies to all employees, including managers. It also applies to all guests, vendors, and independent contractors, as well as to all interns and volunteers (all of whom are designated for the terms of this policy as \"Third Parties\"). Chipotle prohibits managers and employees from harassing subordinates or co-workers, as well as Third Parties. Any such harassment will subject an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination. Chipotle also prohibits Third Parties from harassing our employees, interns, and volunteers.                          OUR RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE POLICIES a harassment problem unless we know about it. Therefore, it is your responsibility to bring your concerns and/or problems to our attention so we can take appropriate steps to address the situation. Chipotle takes all complaints of unlawful harassment seriously and will not penalize you or retaliate against you in any way for reporting a harassment problem in good faith. If you are a manager, and you receive any complaint of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation, you must promptly report such complaint to your HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, or the RWH Team if you are in a restaurant. Failure to promptly escalate or report such complaints may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. All complaints of unlawful harassment which are reported to management will be investigated as promptly as possible by an impartial and qualified person, and upon conclusion of such investigation, appropriate corrective action will be taken where warranted. Chipotle expects employees to cooperate with internal investigations and the internal complaint process. This expectation does not apply to investigations related to proceedings by the National Labor Relations Board and is not intended to conflict with or limit employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act, including the rights to discuss wages, hours, and any other working conditions, and the rights to keep such discussions and activities confidential. All complaints of unlawful harassment reported to management will be treated as confidentially as possible, consistent with Chipotle's need to conduct an adequate investigation. Violation of this policy will subject an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination. Moreover, any manager who allows or ignores potential violations of this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination. This policy should not be interpreted as and will not be applied to restrict any activity that is protected under the National Labor Relations Act, whistleblower laws, or other applicable law. ( D CHIP FORCE CHIPOTLE TIMEKEEPING AND PAYROLL PRACTICES EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES Full-time employees are those normally scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours per week, as determined by Chipotle in its sole discretion. \"Full-time\" is a general employee classification used by Chipotle for a variety of purposes. Employees not classified by Chipotle as \"full-time\" may still be eligible for medical insurance coverage, depending on their position and hours of service. Consult the applicable benefit plan document on the Cultivate Me portal for all information regarding eligibility, coverage and benefits. The benefit plan document ultimately governs your entitlement to benefits. PART-TIME EMPLOYEES Part-time employees are those normally scheduled to work fewer than thirty (30) hours per week, as determined by Chipotle in its sole discretion. NON-EXEMPT (HOURLY) EMPLOYEES Non-exempt (hourly) employees include all employees who are covered by the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state law. EXEMPT (SALARIED) EMPLOYEES Exempt (salaried) employees include all employees who are classified by Chipotle as exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state law. If you have any questions concerning your employee classification or the benefits for which you qualify, please consult the Benefits Administration Team at benefits@chipotle.com . You may also consult the applicable benefit plan document which can be found in the Cultivate Me portal. YOUR PAY Wages are paid every other Friday. A list of all paydays can be found on Chiplinks . On paydays, if you elect to receive your wages via a paper check, your check will be available at your restaurant or the office where you normally report to work on Friday. Paper checks are not to be distributed prior to Friday. We also offer pay cards and direct deposit of employee wages to all employees who provide a written authorization for direct deposit. If the scheduled payday falls on a holiday, wages will generally be distributed on the preceding business day. Any questions about the amount of your pay or deductions should be brought to the attention of the Employee Service Center at 877-625-1919 (option 5) or workdavESC@chipotle.com immediately.   TIMEKEEPING AND PAYROLL PRACTICES Management retains the right to reassign employees to a different shift where it is necessary for the efficient operation of Chipotle. Chipotle may periodically schedule overtime work to meet guest needs. We will attempt to give as much advance notice as possible, or as required by local laws, and we expect that all employees who are scheduled to work overtime will be at work. Otherwise, all overtime work must be pre-approved by your manager. Working overtime without your manager's approval may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. MEAL PERIODS For qualifying shifts, it is our policy to provide and afford employees an uninterrupted thirty (30) minute meal period free from all duty consistent with applicable state law. Please see Chiplinks to reference the meal period policy that applies to the state where you work. REST PERIODS Chipotle complies with all state laws regarding rest periods. Chipotle provides the following benefits to eligible employees. Chipotle reserves the right to terminate or modify these plans at any time for any reason. PAID HOLIDAYS Chipotle may provide paid holidays depending on your location, position, and schedule. A list of paid holidays can be found on Chiplinks . If you have further questions about paid holidays, you may reach out to your manager. PAID VACATION Chipotle provides paid vacation to eligible employees so that you are better able to perform your job when you return. For this reason, we expect you to use your vacation time and do not permit pay in lieu of time off. Vacations must be scheduled and approved by your manager at least two (2) weeks in advance. Chipotle, at its sole discretion, may require you to take your vacation at a particular time, and may also refuse your request for vacation where business needs dictate (except where prohibited by law). You do not continue to accrue vacation during a leave of absence. To be eligible for vacation pay, you must work your last scheduled day before the vacation and the first scheduled day after the vacation, unless you are taking an excused absence on those days. See the instructions on Requesting Time Off at the end of this Handbook. Should you decide to end your employment with Chipotle, unused vacation may not be scheduled after you have notified Chipotle of your resignation. Unused vacation time is not paid out upon termination except where required by law. Please consult the Cultivate Me portal or the Benefits page on Chiplinks for specific information regarding eligibility and offerings. If you still have questions about this benefit, you may reach out to Benefits@chipotle.com . PAID SICK LEAVE Chipotle provides twenty-four (24) hours of paid sick leave to all employees* each year. Where state or local law requires additional paid sick leave, Chipotle will provide such additional paid sick leave. Please consult Chiplinks for any state or local sick leave policies that may be applicable to your work location. Contact the Employee Service Center at 877-625-1919 (option 5) for detailed information on how the dollar amount of your sick pay is calculated and the amount you are entitled to receive. The actual dollar amount that an employee receives may vary according to the compensation plan of the employee. *As an added benefit for Chipo tie employees, if you need to use paid time off during your first ninety (90) days of employment for your own illness, but have not yet accrued sufficient time, you may be eligible to use up to twenty-four (24) hours of paid sick time off before accruing it under this policy You should talk to your manager if you need to use sick time in this circumstance. Any sick time used in this manner will be counted against future accruals. Paid sick leave under this policy may be used in connection with the diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, you or your family member. \"Family member\" for purposes of this policy includes a spouse, registered domestic partner, child (regardless of the child's age), parent (including a step-parent or parent-in-law), grandparent, grandchild, sibling. Leave under this policy may also be used by an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to seek aid or medical attention, obtain services or counseling, or participate in safety planning. To the extent paid sick time may be used for other purposes under applicable local ordinances, such use will be permitted as required. When requesting time off under this policy, you must provide as much advance notice as possible. If your need for paid sick leave is unforeseeable, you must provide notice as soon as practicable. See the instructions on Requesting Time Off at the end of this Handbook. You are encouraged to request leave under this policy without fear of retaliation. Chipotle will not take any adverse action against employees who request or utilize paid sick leave. However, misuse or abuse of this policy (e.g., misrepresenting the reason for use of paid sick leave or using paid sick leave for an impermissible purpose) may result in disciplinary action. Because sick time is designated to provide benefits only to existing employees who temporarily are required to miss work, unused sick time is not payable at any time, including upon termination of employment for any reason. Paid sick leave under this policy may run concurrently with leave taken under local, state, or federal law, including leave taken pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act. For more information regarding this policy, contact benefits@chipotle.com . INSURANCE AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS Chipotle offers insurance and retirement benefits to eligible employees. Please consult the Cultivate Me portal for specific information regarding eligibility and offerings. WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE Chipotle maintains Workers' Compensation insurance, which provides benefits to employees who experience injury or illness that arises out of the course and scope of employment. It is essential that you report all work-related accidents, injuries, and illnesses immediately to your manager. You should be aware that it is unlawful to knowingly file a false or fraudulent claim for Workers' Compensation benefits, or to knowingly submit false or fraudulent information in connection with any Workers' Compensation claim. Such conduct is also against Chipotle policy and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LEAVES OF ABSENCE For all leaves of absence described in this section, in addition to the rules and requirements described in the relevant section, you should also request your leave of absence in Workday per the instructions at the end of this Employee Handbook. Information related to leaves of absence can be found in the Cultivate Me portal. Employees who use any type of leave for unauthorized purposes will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. CIVIC DUTIES Chipotle encourages each of you to accept your civic responsibilities. Jury Duty: If you are required to attend jury duty, please notify your manager immediately so your manager may plan for your absence with as little disruption as possible. Unless otherwise required by federal, state, or local law, time spent serving on jury duty will be unpaid for hourly employees. Salaried employees will continue to receive their regular salary for any week in which they perform any work while on jury duty, pursuant to state and federal law. Employees may, but are not required to use vacation, sick leave, or any other accrued paid leave benefits during any period of unpaid jury duty. If you are released from jury service before the end of your regularly scheduled shift or are not asked to serve on a jury panel, you are expected to call your manager as soon as possible and report to work if requested. Witness Duty: If you receive a subpoena to appear in court, please notify your manager immediately. You are expected to return to work as soon as your service as a witness is completed. Unless otherwise required by state or federal law, time spent serving on witness duty will be unpaid for hourly employees. Salaried employees will continue to receive their regular salary for any week in which they perform any work while on witness duty, pursuant to state and federal law. Employees may, but are not required to use vacation, sick leave, or any other accrued paid leave benefit during any period of unpaid witness duty. If you are released from witness service before the end of your regularly scheduled shift or are not asked to serve as a witness, you are expected to call your manager as soon as possible and report to work if requested. Voting: If you would like to vote in a public election, but do not have sufficient time to vote during non-work hours, you may arrange to take up to two (2) hours off from work with pay to vote. To receive time off for voting, you must notify your manager at least two (2) business days prior to the election and must obtain advance approval from your manager. You also must take the time off to vote either at the beginning or end of your work shift. Chipotle reserves the right to request a copy of your voter's receipt following any time off to vote. MILITARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE Employees who require time off from work to fulfill military duties will be treated in accordance with applicable requirements of state and federal laws. You are expected to notify Chipotle in advance of upcoming military duty by providing your manager with verbal or written notice as soon as possible. You may choose to use any available accrued vacation for an absence described above. MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE Employees who are ineligible for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act as provided below, or who have exceeded their leave allotment under this law, are nonetheless eligible for medical leave according to the following policy: You may be eligible for unpaid leaves of absence for medical reasons. Medical reasons may include illness, injury, medical and surgical procedures, and related medical conditions. You must request a leave of absence if you will be unable to work for medical reasons for a period in excess of five (5) consecutive days. Such requests are subject to management approval and must be made as soon as possible. Each request must be accompanied by a certification from your treating physician or a Chipotle-approved physician which states that you are unable to work and provides the duration of leave that you require. Chipotle reserves the right to require examination by a physician of Chipotle's choice prior to granting a medical leave of absence under this policy. Chipotle may require periodic physician's verification of your inability to work. Misrepresenting the reason for applying for a leave of absence may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. During a medical leave of absence, Chipotle's medical insurance plan documents will determine whether you and your eligible dependents may continue your health insurance coverage under Chipotle's plan. If you remain eligible for such coverage you must pay your share of the premium the same as if you continued working. If you are not eligible to continue coverage under Chipotle's plan you will be issued a COBRA notice and given the option of continuing coverage at your own expense. The plan document ultimately governs your eligibility for and entitlement to these benefits. The duration of a medical leave of absence will depend not only on the length of time your doctor certifies you need but also how much time can be provided as a reasonable accommodation without your absence causing the Company to suffer an undue hardship. Upon your return from a medical leave of absence, we will attempt to return you to your regular job if it is available. If it is not available, you will be placed in a similar job for which you are deemed by management to be qualified if such a job is available. If no jobs are available at the time, you will be given preferential consideration for any position for which you apply and for which you are deemed by management to be qualified following your notifying Chipotle in writing that you are ready and able to return to work. Failure to report to work as scheduled following a leave of absence without notifying Chipotle of your need for additional leave may result in termination. Employees who are out on a leave of absence will not accrue such benefits as vacation or holiday pay during their leaves of absence. You should talk with your manager and contact benefits@chipotle.com prior to taking a leave to ensure you understand your rights and obligations while on leave. Failure to comply with Chipotle policy may substantially affect your ability to return to work and/or result in the loss of health insurance coverage. OTHER EMPLOYMENT While on a leave of absence, you are prohibited from holding other employment, including self­ employment, not held immediately prior to the start of the leave. In other words, if you have another job in addition to your job with Chipotle, you may continue working that job while on leave from Chipotle if medically able to do so, but you may not seek and hold other employment to replace your employment with Chipotle while on leave. This policy remains in force during all leaves of absence including medical leave. Violation of this provision may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment. FRAUD Providing false or misleading information or omitting material information in connection with any medical leave will result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT The Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") provides eligible employees the opportunity to take unpaid, job-protected leave for certain specified reasons. The maximum amount of leave you may use is either twelve (12) or twenty-six (26) weeks within a twelve (12) month period depending on the reasons for the leave. EMPLOYEE ELIGIBILITY To be eligible for FMLA leave, you must: Have worked at least twelve (12) months for Chipotle in the preceding seven (7) years (limited exceptions apply to the seven-year requirement); Have worked at least 1,250 hours for Chipotle over the twelve (12) months preceding the date your leave would begin; and Currently work at a location where there are at least fifty (50) employees within seventy- five (75) miles. All periods of absence from work due to or necessitated by service in the uniformed services are counted in determining FMLA eligibility. REASONS FOR TAKING LEAVE FMLA leave may be taken for the following reasons: Birth of an employee's child, including time for bonding with the child after birth (up to twelve (12) weeks). Such time is available to employees regardless of sex, gender identity or expression; Placement of a child with the employee in connection with the adoption or foster care of the child by the employee (up to twelve (12) weeks). Such time is available to employees regardless of sex, gender identity or expression; To care for an immediate family member (employee's spouse, child or parent) with a serious health condition (up to twelve (12) weeks); Because of an employee's serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position (up to twelve (12) weeks); To care for a Covered Servicemember with a serious injury or illness related to certain types of military service (up to twenty-six (26) weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details); or To handle certain qualifying circumstances arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, child, or parent is on duty under a call or order to active duty in the Uniformed Services (up to twelve (12) weeks) (see Military-Related FMLA Leave for more details). The maximum amount of leave that may be taken in a twelve (12) month period for all reasons combined is twelve (12) weeks, with one exception. For leave to care for a Covered Servicemember, the maximum combined leave entitlement is twenty-six (26) weeks, with leaves for all other reasons constituting no more than twelve (12) of those twenty-six (26) weeks. DEFINITIONS A \"Serious Health Condition\" is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either (i) an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or (ii) continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee's job or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities for more than three (3) full calendar days. The continuing treatment requirement includes two (2) visits to a health care provider or one (1) visit to a health care provider and a continuing regimen of care. An incapacity caused by pregnancy or prenatal visits, a chronic condition (such as asthma, diabetes or migraines) that continues over an extended period of time and requires periodic visits (at least two (2) per year) to a health care provider, permanent or long-term conditions requiring supervision but not active treatment by a health care provider, or absences due to multiple treatments ordered by a health care provider may also meet the definition of a Serious Health Condition. IDENTIFYING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD Chipotle measures the twelve (12) month period in which leave is taken by the \"rolling\" twelve (12) month method, measured backward from the date of any FMLA leave with one exception. For leave to care for a Covered Servicemember, Chipotle calculates the twelve (12) month period beginning on the first day the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for a Covered Servicemember and ends twelve (12) months after that date. FMLA leave for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care must be concluded within twelve (12) months of the birth or placement. USING LEAVE Eligible employees may take FMLA leave in a single block of time, intermittently (in separate blocks of time), or by reducing the normal work schedule (including the elimination of required overtime) when medically necessary for the serious health condition of the employee or immediate family member, or in the case of a Covered Servicemember, their injury or illness. Eligible employees may also take intermittent or reduced-schedule leave for military qualifying exigencies. Employees who require intermittent or reduced-schedule leave for planned medical treatment must make a reasonable effort to schedule their leave so that it will not unreasonably disrupt Chipotle's operations. Intermittent leave is permitted in increments of at least one (1) hour. USE OF PAID LEAVE Depending on the purpose of your leave, Chipotle may require you to use accrued paid leave (such as sick leave, vacation, or PTO (Paid Time Off)), concurrently with some or all of your FMLA leave. If Chipotle does not require you to do so, you may elect to substitute paid leave for FMLA leave, so long as you comply with Chipotle's normal procedures for the applicable paid-leave policy (e.g., call­ in procedures, advance notice, etc.). Additionally, depending on the purpose of your leave request, you may choose to take leave pursuant to a short- or long-term disability leave plan, during the otherwise unpaid portion of your FMLA leave. This paid disability leave runs concurrently with FMLA leave and may continue longer than the FMLA leave if permitted by the disability leave plan. MAINTENANCE OF HEALTH BENEFITS If you and/or your family participate in our group health plan, Chipotle will maintain coverage during your FMLA leave on the same terms as if you had continued to work. If applicable, you must make arrangements to pay your share of health plan premiums while on leave. In some instances, Chipotle may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage or other benefits for you and your family. Use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of your leave. Consult the applicable plan document on the Cultivate Me portal or email benefits@chipotle.com for all information regarding eligibility, coverage and benefits. NOTICE AND MEDICAL CERTIFICATION When seeking FMLA leave, you must provide: Sufficient information for us to determine if the requested leave may qualify for FMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Sufficient information may include that you are unable to perform job functions, a family member is unable to perform daily activities, the need for hospitalization or continuing treatment by a health care provider, or circumstances supporting the need for military family leave. You must also inform Chipotle if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. Thirty (30) days advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave, if the need for leave is foreseeable, or notice as soon as practicable in the case of unforeseeable leave and in compliance with Chipotle's normal call-in procedures, absent unusual circumstances; Medical certification supporting the need for leave due to a serious health condition affecting you or an immediate family member within fifteen (15) calendar days of Chipotle's request to provide the certification (additional time may be permitted in some circumstances). If you fail to do so, Chipotle may delay the commencement of your leave, withdraw any designation of FMLA leave or deny the leave, in which case your leave of absence would be treated in accordance with our standard leave of absence and attendance policies, subjecting you to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Second or third medical opinions and periodic re-certifications may also be required; Periodic reports as deemed appropriate during the leave regarding your status and intent to return to work; and Medical certification of fitness for duty before returning to work, if the leave was due to your serious health condition, as permitted by law. Chipotle will require this certification to address whether you can perform the essential functions of your position. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in delay or denial of leave, or disciplinary action, up to and including termination. EMPLOVER RESPONSIBlLITIES To the extent required by law, Chipotle will inform you whether you are eligible for leave under the FMLA. If you are eligible for FMLA/CFRA leave, Chipotle will provide you with a notice that specifies any additional information required as well as your rights and responsibilities. Chipotle will also inform you if leave will be designated as FMLA-protected and, to the extent possible, note the amount of leave counted against your leave entitlement. If you are not eligible for FMLA leave, Chipotle will provide a reason for the ineligibility. JOB RESTORATION To the extent required by applicable law, upon returning from FMLA leave, you will be restored to the same or a comparable position as the position held prior to the leave. FAILURE TO RETURN AFTER FMLA LEAVE If you fail to return to work as scheduled after FMLA leave or you exceed the twelve (12) week FMLA entitlement (or in the case of military caregiver leave, the twenty-six (26) week FMLA entitlement), you will be subject to Chipotle's standard leave of absence and attendance policies. This may result in termination if you have no other Chipotle-provided leave available to you that applies to your continued absence. Likewise, following the conclusion of your FMLA leave, Chipotle's obligation to maintain your group health plan benefits may end (subject to any applicable COBRA rights). If you are unable to return to work after FMLA leave, you must notify your manager and benefits@chipotle.com . If Chipotle becomes aware of the need for additional leave, Chipotle will engage in an interactive process to determine whether the condition is a disability for which additional unpaid leave may be provided as a reasonable accommodation. OTHER EMPLOYMENT While on a leave of absence, you are prohibited from holding other employment, including self­ employment, not held immediately prior to the start of the leave. In other words, if you have another job in addition to your job with Chipotle, you may continue working that job while on leave from Chipotle if medically able to do so, but you may not seek and hold other employment to replace your employment with Chipotle while on leave. This policy remains in force during all leaves of absence including FMLA leave. Violation of this provision may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment. FRAUD Providing false or misleading information or omitting material information in connection with an FMLA leave will result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination. MILITARY-RELATED FMLA LEAVE FMLA leave may also be available to eligible employees in connection with certain service-related medical and non-medical needs of family members. There are two forms of such leave. The first is Military Caregiver Leave, and the second is Qualifying Exigency Leave. Each of these leaves is detailed below. DEFINITIONS A \"Covered Servicemember\" is either: (1) a current Servicemember of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, with a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty for which the Servicemember is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list; or (2) a \"covered veteran\" who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness. A \"Covered Veteran\" is an individual who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable during the five (5) year period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran. The period between October 28, 2009 and March 8, 2013 is excluded in determining this five (5) year period. The FMLA definitions of \"serious injury or illness\" for current Servicemembers and veterans are distinct from the FMLA definition of \"serious health condition.\" For purposes of Military-Related FMLA Leave, the term \"serious injury or illness\" means an injury or illness incurred by the Servicemember in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the Servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of the Servicemember's office, grade, rank, or rating, or one that existed before the beginning of active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty. With regard to covered veterans, the serious injury or illness may manifest itself before or after the individual assumed veteran status, and is: 1) a continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and rendered the Servicemember unable to perform the duties of the Servicemember's office, grade, rank or rating; 2) a physical or mental condition for which the covered veteran has received a VA Service Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or greater and such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the condition precipitating the need for caregiver leave; 3) a physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the veteran's ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or disabilities related to military service or would be so absent treatment; or 4) an injury, including a psychological injury, on the basis of which the covered veteran has been enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. \"Qualifying exigencies\" include activities such as short-notice deployment, military events, arranging alternative childcare, making financial and legal arrangements related to the deployment, rest and recuperation, counseling, parental care, and post-deployment debriefings. MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE Unpaid Military Caregiver Leave is designed to allow eligible employees to care for certain family members who have sustained serious injuries or illnesses in the line of duty while on active duty. The family member must be a \"Covered Servicemember,\" which means: 1) a current member or veteran of the Armed Forces, National Guard or Reserves, 2) who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy or, in the case of a veteran, who was a member of the Armed Forces, National Guard or Reserves, who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable at any time within five years prior to the treatment which an eligible employee requests; is otherwise in outpatient status; or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, 3) for a serious injury or illness that may render current member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's office, grade, rank, or rating. Military Caregiver Leave is not available to care for Servicemembers on the permanent disability retired list. Serious injury or illness specifically includes, but is not limited to, aggravation of a preexisting condition while in the line of duty. To be eligible for Military Caregiver Leave, you must be a spouse, child, parent, or next of kin of the Covered Servicemember. \"Next of kin\" means the nearest blood relative of the Servicemember, other than the Servicemember's spouse, parent, child, in the following order of priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the Servicemember by court decree or statutory provisions; sibling; grandparents; parent's siblings; and first cousins; unless the Servicemember has specifically designated in writing another blood relative as their nearest blood relative for purposes of Military Caregiver Leave. You must also meet all other eligibility standards as set forth within the FMLA Leave policy. An eligible employee may take up to twenty-six (26) workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave to care for a Covered Servicemember in a \"single twelve (12) month period.\" The \"single twelve (12) month period\" begins on the first day leave is taken to care for a Covered Servicemember and ends twelve (12) months thereafter, regardless of the method used to determine leave availability for other FMLA­ qualifying reasons. If you do not exhaust your twenty-six (26) workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave during this \"single twelve (12) month period,\" the remainder is forfeited. Military Caregiver Leave applies on a per-injury basis for each Servicemember. Consequently, an eligible employee may take separate periods of caregiver leave for each and every Covered Servicemember, and/or for each and every serious injury or illness of the same Covered Servicemember. A total of no more than twenty-six (26) workweeks of Military Caregiver Leave, however, may be taken within any single twelve (12) month period. Within the \"single twelve (12) month period\" described above, an eligible employee may take a combined total of twenty-six (26) weeks of FMLA leave including up to twelve (12) weeks of leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason (i.e., birth or adoption of a child, serious health condition of the employee or close family member, or a qualifying exigency). For example, during the \"single twelve (12) month period,\" an eligible employee may take up to sixteen (16) weeks of FMLA leave to care for a Covered Servicemember when combined with up to ten (10) weeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child. An employee seeking Military Caregiver Leave may be required to provide appropriate certification from the employee and/or Covered Servicemember and completed by an authorized health care provider within fifteen (15) days. Military Caregiver Leave is subject to the other provisions in our FMLA Leave Policy (requirements regarding employee eligibility, appropriate notice of the need for leave, use of accrued paid leave, etc.). Military Caregiver Leave will be governed by, and handled in accordance with, the FMLA and applicable regulations, and nothing within this policy should be construed to be inconsistent with those regulations. QUALIFYING EXIGENCY LEAVE Eligible employees may take unpaid \"Qualifying Exigency Leave\" to tend to certain \"exigencies\" arising out of the duty under a call or order to active duty of a \"covered military member\" (i.e., the employee's spouse, child, or parent). Up to twelve (12) weeks of Qualifying Exigency Leave is available in any twelve (12) month period, as measured by the same method that governs measurement of other forms of FMLA leave within the FMLA policy (with the exception of Military Caregiver Leave, which is subject to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of leave in a \"single twelve (12) month period\"). The maximum amount of \"Qualifying Exigency Leave\" an employee may utilize to bond with a military member on short-term, temporary rest and recuperation during deployment is fifteen (15) days. Although Qualifying Exigency Leave may be combined with leave for other FMLA-qualifying reasons, under no circumstances may the combined total exceed twelve (12) weeks in any twelve (12) month period (with the exception of Military Caregiver Leave as set forth above). The employee must meet all other eligibility standards as set forth within the FMLA policy. Persons who can be ordered to active duty include active and retired members of the Regular Armed Forces, certain members of the retired Reserve, and various other Reserve members including the Ready Reserve, the Selected Reserve, the Individual Ready Reserve, the National Guard, state military, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. A call to active duty refers to a federal call to active duty, and state calls to active duty are not covered unless under the order of the President of the United States pursuant to certain laws. Qualifying Exigency Leave is available under the following circumstances: Short-notice deployment. To address any issue that arises out of short notice (within seven days or less) of an impending call or order to active duty. Military events and related activities. To attend any official military ceremony, program, or event related to active duty or a call to active-duty status or to attend certain family support or assistance programs and informational briefings. Childcare and school activities. To arrange for alternative childcare; to provide childcare on an urgent, immediate need basis; to enroll in or transfer to a new school or daycare facility; or to attend meetings with staff at a school or daycare facility. Financial and legal arrangements. To make or update various financial or legal arrangements; or to act as the covered military member's representative before a federal, state, or local agency in connection with service benefits. Counseling. To attend counseling (by someone other than a health care provider) for the employee, the covered military member, or for a child or dependent when necessary as a result of duty under a call or order to active duty. Temporary rest and recuperation. To spend time with a covered military member who is on short-term, temporary rest and recuperation leave during the period of deployment. Eligible employees may take up to fifteen (15) days of leave for each instance of rest and recuperation. Post-deployment activities. To attend arrival ceremonies, reintegration briefings and events, and any other official ceremony or program sponsored by the military for a period of up to ninety (90) days following termination of the covered military member's active-duty status. This also encompasses leave to address issues that arise from the death of a covered military member while on active-duty status. Mutually agreed leave. Other events that arise from the close family member's call or order to active duty, provided that Chipotle and the employee agree that such leave qualifies as an exigency and agree to both the timing and duration of such leave. An employee seeking Qualifying Exigency Leave may be required to submit appropriate supporting documentation in the form of a copy of the covered military member's active duty orders or other military documentation indicating the appropriate military status and the dates of active duty status, along with a statement setting forth the nature and details of the specific exigency, the amount of leave needed and the employee's relationship to the military member, within fifteen (15) days. Qualifying Exigency Leave will be governed by, and handled in accordance with, the FMLA and applicable regulations, and nothing within this policy should be construed to be inconsistent with those regulations. PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE Additional types of unpaid personal leaves of absence may be granted in the sole discretion of management, for up to a maximum of thirty (30) days. An extension beyond thirty (30) days will be considered on an individual basis. Failure to report to work as scheduled following a personal leave of absence may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Time spent on personal leave of absence will not be used for computing benefits such as vacation or holidays. You should speak directly with your manager and benefits@chipotle.com prior to taking a leave to ensure your understanding of all of your obligations to Chipotle while on leave, such as your periodic reporting and re-verification obligations. Failure to comply with Chipotle's policy may substantially affect your ability to return to work under this policy. BEREAVEMENT LEAVE Full-time employees may be eligible for bereavement leave. More information about this benefit can be found in the Cultivate Me portal. Salaried employees may be provided time off with pay for any of the above-described leaves when necessary to comply with state and federal wage and hour laws. COURTESY AND PROFESSIONALISM Employees who engage in contact with guests, vendors, and/or members of the public in the course of their job duties must show such persons courtesy and professionalism at all times. Rudeness or profanity in the presence of our guests, vendors, and/or members of the public will not be tolerated, and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Cooperation and respect amongst team members while fulfilling their job duties is necessary to ensure the highest quality service to our guests. This is not intended to conflict or limit employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act including the rights to discuss wages, hours, and other working conditions. Failure to conduct oneself professionally and live Chipotle's values in the presence of our guests, vendors, and/or members of the public creates a difficult working environment and prevents Chipotle from providing quality service to our guests. If you consistently fail to approach your job duties in a professional manner in the presence of guests, vendors, and/or members of the public, you may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. We encourage positive and collaborative interactions at Chipotle that create leadership and teamwork in the presence of guests, vendors, and/or members of the public. FOOD SAFETY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Chipotle is committed to serving only safe, high-quality food in our restaurants, and our food safety programs and practices are designed to prevent public health risks that can occur from improper handling, preparing, and storing food. All employees must comply with Chipotle's food safety programs and practices, including Chipotle's Critical Control Points, Illness Policy , Handwashing Policy . and Food Safety Seven, and complete all trainings and certifications that may be required for your position, including DOJ Food Safety Training, ServSafe, HACCP, Onboarding Training, state specific food handling cards, and Quarterly Food Safety Training. Chipotle adheres to federal, state, and local regulations regulating food safety. In your role, you may be required or asked by our Food Safety and Compliance teams to conduct, participate in, or respond to audits related to Food Safety. Failure to comply with Chipotle's food safety programs and practices, including audits, training, or failure to timely complete food safety compliance requirements, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. This employee Handbook does not list all the requirements and responsibilities pertaining to Food Safety and compliance. Any questions or concerns related to food safety, including our practices and policies or requirements should be sent to FoodSafetvCompliance@chipotle.com . ALCOHOL AND DRUG POLICY All employees are prohibited from manufacturing, cultivating, distributing, dispensing, possessing, or using illegal drugs and cannabis or THC-containing products (regardless of prescription) or other unauthorized, mind-altering, or intoxicating substances while on Chipotle property (including parking areas and grounds), or while otherwise performing their work duties away from Chipotle's premises. Included within this prohibition are lawful controlled substances which have been illegally or improperly obtained. This policy does not prohibit the possession and proper use of lawfully prescribed drugs taken in accordance with the prescription, other than cannabis or THC-containing products. Employees are also prohibited from being under the influence of any such illegal or unauthorized controlled substances (and cannabis or THC-containing products regardless of prescription) while at work and from having excessive amounts of otherwise lawful controlled substances in their systems. All employees are prohibited from distributing, dispensing, possessing, or using alcohol while at work or on duty. Furthermore, off-duty alcohol use, while generally not prohibited by this policy, must not interfere with your ability to perform the essential functions of your job. From time to time, Chipotle may host events where alcohol is served. During these authorized Chipotle events, employees are permitted to engage in moderate consumption of alcohol that is served. Employees are expected to exercise good personal judgement concerning alcohol consumption and must not overindulge. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS With the exception of medically prescribed cannabis or THC-containing products, the proper use of medication prescribed by your physician is not prohibited while working; however, we do prohibit the misuse of prescribed medication. Employees' drug use may affect their safety and job performance, such as by causing dizziness or drowsiness. You are required to disclose to your manager any medication that may cause a risk of harm to yourself or to others in performing your job duties. It is your responsibility to determine from your physician whether a prescribed drug may impair your job performance. NOTIFICATION OF IMPAIRMENT Each employee who observes or has knowledge of another employee in a condition which impairs the employee in the performance of their job duties, or who presents a hazard to the safety and welfare of others, or is otherwise in violation of this policy, must promptly report that fact to their manager or another member of management. WHO IS TESTED? You may be required to submit to drug or alcohol screening whenever Chipotle has a reasonable suspicion that you have violated any of the rules set forth in this policy. Reasonable suspicion may arise from, among other factors, supervisory observation, co-worker reports or complaints, performance decline, attendance or behavioral changes, results of searches or other detection methods, or involvement in a work-related injury or accident that may have been caused by drug or alcohol impairment (to the extent permitted by applicable law). Injury or accident-based testing does not apply where the incident or accident is unlikely to have occurred as a result of drug or alcohol use, or where the cause of the incident or injury is known or clear (e.g., back sprains from lifting a heavy object, bug bites that require treatment, etc.). Additionally, employees in safety sensitive positions may be tested on a random or periodic basis to the extent permitted by applicable state and federal laws. ENFORCEMENT POLICY In order to enforce this policy and procedures, Chipotle may investigate potential violations and require employees to undergo drug or alcohol screening, including urinalysis, blood tests, or other appropriate tests (as permitted by applicable law) and, where appropriate, searches of all areas of Chipotle's physical premises, including, but not limited to work areas, personal articles, employee's clothes, desks, workstations, lockers, and personal and Chipotle vehicles. DISCIPLINE Violation of this policy or any of its provisions may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Violations include but are not limited to the following: Refusing to cooperate with searches or investigations Failing to execute testing consent forms when required by Chipotle Refusing to submit to testing or not showing up for a scheduled test Tampering with any testing sample Testing positive for illegal drugs or unauthorized, mind-altering, or intoxicating substances Testing positive for excessive amounts of otherwise lawful controlled substances. DAMAGE TO PROPERTY Deliberate or careless damage to a co-worker's, vendor's, or guest's property or Chipotle's property will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Any personal property brought to work is your sole responsibility. Chipotle will not be responsible for an employee's lost or damaged personal property.. FRAUD, DISHONESTY, AND FALSE STATEMENTS Employees and applicants are prohibited from providing false, dishonest, or misleading information on any application, medical history record, leave request, invoice, time entry, investigative questionnaire and meetings, workplace injury report, or any other Chipotle document. Employees are likewise prohibited from making any maliciously false statements to an employee, customer, partner, or third party. Under the law, an employee may be held personally liable for making knowingly false or defamatory statements to guests. Any employee found to have made knowingly false, or defamatory statements as detailed above will be subject to immediate termination of employment. If you observe any such violations, please report them to your HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, the RWH Team if you are in a restaurant, or to any other member of management. GAMBLING Gambling is prohibited on Chipotle property, or through the use of Chipotle's property, such as computers and telephone equipment, and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT Our success depends in a large part on the relationships we develop with our suppliers and business partners, which may involve exchanging gifts, sharing business meals, attending entertainment events, and other business courtesies. However, we must be careful to make sure that these activities do not create or appear to create a sense of obligation on either party or compromise our professional judgment as Chipotle employees. Please refer our Code of Ethics for information on our policy regarding Gifts and Entertainment. ILLEGAL ACTIVITY Employees are not permitted to engage in any kind of illegal activity while on duty or on Chipotle's premises/facilities, or while off the job which reflects detrimentally on Chipotle's reputation. Employees who engage in illegal activity may be disciplined or terminated and may also be reported to law enforcement. INSUBORDINATION We all have duties to perform, and every employee must follow directions from their manager. Employees must not refuse to follow the reasonable, job-related directions of a member of management or to otherwise treat a member of management in an insubordinate manner as it relates to the performance of their job duties. Employees who engage in insubordinate conduct may be disciplined or terminated. This requirement is not intended to conflict with or limit employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act, including the rights to discuss wages, hours, and any other working conditions. MISUSE OF PROPERTY Employees are prohibited from misusing, or using without authorization, equipment, vehicles or the property of Chipotle, guests, vendors, or other employees of Chipotle. Any non-business use of Chipotle's office equipment must be approved by management. Misuse of property may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. OFF-DUTY USE OF CHIPOTLE FACILITIES/PREMISES Employees are prohibited from being inside Chipotle premises or any external working areas if they interfere with other employees who are working. Employees are expressly prohibited from using Chipotle facilities, property, or equipment for personal use. Violation of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. OFF-DUTY SOCIAL AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES During the year, Chipotle may sponsor social or recreational activities for its employees. Your attendance at these events is completely voluntary and not required as a condition of employment, and the time spent will not be considered time worked. Neither Chipotle nor its insurer will be liable employees. Employees who are provided with uniforms must keep them in a neat and clean condition and must wear them at all times when on duty. You should dress and present yourself in a manner that reflects the professionalism that you bring to teaching and tasting Chipotle every day. We feel that these qualities go further than any other factor in making a favorable impression on guests and your co-workers and also help to keep you safe. Employees who report to work in attire that violates Chipotle's Uniform Policy may be required to leave work and return in acceptable attire. Such time away from work will be without pay. Chipotle will not enforce this policy in violation of any federal, state, or local equal employment opportunity laws. Chipotle will provide reasonable accommodations to this policy for an employee's religious beliefs and practices, medical needs, or other protected reasons, provided the requested accommodation does not create an undue hardship for Chipotle and/or does not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace and/or to the individual. Once Chipotle is aware of the need for an accommodation, Chipotle will engage in an interactive process to identify possible accommodations. For more information, please see the Reasonable Accommodation Policy . YOUR PERFORMANCE You are expected to make every effort to learn your job and to perform at a level satisfactory to Chipotle at all times. This includes following through on the reasonable, job-related instructions and requests of your managers. Consistent failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK All employees receive performance feedback at regular intervals. Additionally, Chipotle encourages you to talk with your manager about your future goals and growth. Do not feel that you need to wait for a formal feedback meeting to discuss job issues, your career opportunities, or your performance. If you need help or training in certain aspects of your job, let your manager know. If you have not had a performance feedback discussion, or received your performance review, please contact your manager or your manager's manager or HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC or the RWH Team if you are in a restaurant. PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP POLICY Chipotle is committed to maintaining a friendly, but professional working environment. The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for employees who have or develop personal relationships in the workplace. This policy is designed to prevent potential issues that may arise from such relationships, including but not limited to problems/perceptions with supervision and favoritism, potential conflicts of interest, safety and security, morale, and other issues that may cause disruption or create a negative or unprofessional work environment. EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES While Chipotle does not prohibit the hiring relatives of employees, family members will typically not be eligible for employment with Chipotle where potential problems of supervision, safety, security or morale, or potential conflicts of interest exist. More specifically, family members will not be hired into or transferred into positions where they would have authority over, direct or indirect supervision of, or would otherwise be supervised by another family member. Chipotle also reserves the right to determine if a close enough familial relationship exists to prohibit a supervisory relationship. It further reserves the right to take all steps it deems necessary to prevent conflicts of interest. For the purposes of this policy, \"family member\" shall include a spouse, parent, domestic partner, child, sibling, parent's sibling, grandparent, grandchild, sibling's child, in-law or step-relative, cousins, a relative of a domestic partner in one of these relationships, or any person residing in the same household as the employee. ROMANTIC/PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP POLICY FOR MANAGERS Any involvement of a romantic or consensual physical and/or sexual nature between any supervisory employee and any subordinate employee, either directly or indirectly, must be immediately reported by both participating employees to the Team Director, Functional Leader, or HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, or RWH Team if you are in a restaurant. Once reported, the Team Director and/or Functional Leader or respective HR Business Partner or RWH Team representative will meet with the respective employees to discuss the best course of action and will take all steps it deems necessary to prevent conflicts of interest. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NON-MANAGERIAL ADULT EMPLOYEES Chipotle expects all adult employees involved in a consensual physical, sexual and/or romantic relationship while working for Chipotle to behave professionally at all times. Such employees must avoid inappropriate behavior while at the workplace or while on Chipotle's paid time or business, including refraining from public displays of affection, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, and sexually oriented joking. If Chipotle determines that a relationship between two peer employees with no reporting relationship presents an actual or potential conflict of interest or is disruptive in a manner inconsistent with the goals of this policy, Chipotle reserves the right to take all steps it deems necessary to prevent conflicts of interest. ROMANTIC/PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH MINOR EMPLOYEES ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED All employees, including supervisory employees and employee peers, are prohibited from engaging in or pursuing romantic, physical and/or sexual relationships with any minor employee under the age of 18. All employees are further prohibited from engaging in conduct with any minor employee that may create the appearance of impropriety or lead to conduct that is not in Chipotle's interest. This policy will be strictly enforced, and any violation will result in termination of employment. All employees must also remember that Chipotle maintains a strict policy against unlawful harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment. SMOKING Smoking is prohibited in all Chipotle buildings and vehicles. This policy specifically extends to electronic cigarettes (\"e-cigarettes\") and any other personal vaporizing devices. Smoking must be confined to designated outdoor areas. Of course, smoking is prohibited in all areas where hazardous and flammable materials are present. Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. SOLICITATION - DISTRIBUTION POLICY Our primary goal at Chipotle is to provide our guests with the best service possible. In order to allow employees to perform their job duties and provide our guests with their undivided attention, the solicitation by an employee of another employee for the support of any organization is prohibited during the working time of either employee. In addition, the distribution of paper advertising materials, handbills or other literature is prohibited during working time and is prohibited in all working areas and sales areas at all times. Working areas include those areas of restaurants where employees perform their job duties or responsibilities. Similarly, non-employees may not come on to Chipotle's property at any time to solicit for any cause or distribute material or literature of any kind for any purpose. Violation of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, as permitted by applicable law. THEFT Theft of money or property from Chipotle, your co-workers, or guests is strictly prohibited and a crime punishable by state and/or federal laws. Employees found to have stolen or misappropriated money or property will be subject to immediate termination and will also be reported to law enforcement. Chipotle reserves the right to inspect all handbags, briefcases, backpacks, packages, lockers, and vehicles on Chipotle's property to investigate allegations of theft. Failure to cooperate in such a search will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. WORKPLACE VIOLENCE POLICY Chipotle has a zero-tolerance policy for violent acts or threats of violence against our employees, applicants, guests, or vendors. Our full policy is linked here . We do not allow fighting, violent, or threatening words, or conduct. Employees, visitors, and guests are strictly prohibited from bringing dangerous weapons on Chipotle premises, including in Chipotle vehicles, except as authorized by Safety and Asset Protection. No employee may commit or threaten to commit any violent act against a co-worker or Third Parties. This includes discussions of the use of dangerous weapons, such as bombs, guns, or knives, even in a joking manner, made by employees or non-employees (e.g., guests, vendors, former employees, personal relationship partners/friends, etc.). Employees who are subjected to or threatened with violence in the workplace or are aware of another individual who has been subjected to or threatened with violence, are to report this information to their manager, People Experience, or Safety & Asset Protection as soon as possible. All threats should be taken seriously. Please bring ill_[ threats to our attention so that we can deal with them appropriately. All threats will be thoroughly investigated, and all complaints which are reported to management will be treated with as much confidentiality as possible. Employees who threaten or commit acts of violence may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. BACKGROUND SCREENING Chipotle reserves the right to require background screening on all of its employees. If you have any questions about background screening at Chipotle, please contact your HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, or the RWH Team if you are in a restaurant. CHIPOTLE KEYS/ENTRY CARDS Each employee to whom a key and/or entry card is given is responsible for proper use of that key and/or entry card and may be required to sign for it. A lost or misplaced key and/or entry card must be reported immediately to your manager. Never duplicate or loan a key and/or entry card to anyone for any reason. Restaurant employees contact your manager, and RSC employees contact your building's receptionist or Asset Protection Agent if you need another key and/or entry card. All keys and/or entry cards must be turned in to your manager or HR Business Partner upon separation from Chipotle. Employees who take a leave of absence must turn in any keys, POS cards and/or entry cards prior to beginning their leave. HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC MATERIALS If your job requires that you use hazardous or toxic materials or chemicals, you are expected to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations concerning their safe handling and disposal. If you have any questions about the materials you work with or the proper safety or disposal procedures to follow, please refer to the Safety Data Sheets found on Chiplinks > Quick Links. If you need additional assistance, please reach out to your manager or EHS@Chipotle.com to discuss before taking any action. HOUSEKEEPING Work areas must be maintained in a clean, healthy, and orderly fashion to prevent unsafe conditions and potential accidents. If you observe potential workplace hazards, conditions, or equipment that may be dangerous to you or your co-workers, report them immediately to your manager. It is each employee's responsibility to make sure the work environment is always maintained in a hygienic, unobstructed, and organized manner to prevent accidents. MEETINGS From time to time, individual or group meetings may be scheduled either during or outside of your normal working hours. You are required to attend all job-related meetings which you have been asked to attend, unless excused by your manager. If you are an hourly employee, you must report your time attending such meetings, and will be paid for your time. PARKING To maintain sufficient and convenient parking for our guests, we require all of our employees to park their vehicles in the area designated for employee parking where applicable. If you have any questions as to where you should park your vehicle, please ask your manager. EMPLOYEE RECORDS Recognizing the confidential nature of the information in your employee records, Chipotle limits access to the employee records to you and those with proper authorization or pursuant to legal process. No documents or other information contained in your employee records will be released without your consent, except pursuant to legal process. Any records of medical evaluation results will be maintained in a separate file, in accordance with legal requirements, and may only be reviewed by authorized individuals. You may review your own employee records with your HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC or the RWH Team if you are in the restaurants. Additionally, a manager may review your employee records if you have a current reporting relationship to that manager or have been interviewed and are being considered for a position reporting to that manager. Your employee records also are subject to review by investigative agencies, or during periodic internal audits conducted by Chipotle. Within thirty (30) days of an employee's written request, or the written request of the employee's designated representative, Chipotle will either make employee records available to the employee for inspection or provide a copy of the employee's employee records to the employee or the employee's designated representative. The employee may be responsible for the cost of copying the records. SAFETY It is Chipotle's policy to promote safety on the job, and all employees have a responsibility for creating a safe work environment. The health and well-being of our employees is Chipotle's top priority. For this reason, every employee is urged to follow common sense safety practices, and immediately report any observed unsafe conditions to their manager. By reporting potentially unsafe conditions, you are helping Chipotle identify the hazard, correct it, and implement preventative measures to keep you and your peers from illness, injury, or harm while performing your normal duties. You will not be reprimanded for reporting potentially unsafe condition(s), but rather will be appreciated for bringing it to management's attention so it can be appropriately addressed. Remember: safety is everyone's responsibility, not only the managers'. You are a critical part of the solution. Chipotle will provide a safe working environment for its employees in compliance with applicable occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Management is responsible for ensuring that all employees adhere to safe work practices and procedures to prevent injuries and are allotting adequate time for employees to complete training is related to their specific work tasks to minimize exposure to workplace hazards. All accidents, whether it involves a minor or serious injury involving employees and guests, must be reported immediately to your manager. It is only through full knowledge of every accident that Chipotle can continue to better refine our processes and maintain a safe and healthy place for everyone to work. Consult Chipotle's EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) Program Manua l found on the Policies page of Chiplinks under Environmental Health and Safety, for additional information. REMEMBER: SAFETY FIRST. SEARCHES AND INSPECTIONS In order to protect the safety and property of all of our employees, Chipotle reserves the right to inspect employees' lockers, desks, cabinets, briefcases, backpacks, toolboxes, handbags, personal computers, personal motor vehicles, and any other personal belongings brought onto Chipotle property. Employees are expected to cooperate in any search. Failure to cooperate will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. TRAVEL AND EXPENSE POLICY Chipotle will reimburse employees for all approved, reasonable, and necessary business-related expenses in accordance with our Travel and Expense Policy located on Chiplinks. This comprehensive policy addresses all travel and expense related matters, including but not limited to travel, meals, entertainment, team activities, use of personal and company vehicles, office supplies/equipment, P­ eard administration, and other miscellaneous business expenses. TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION Chipotle invests in information technology to facilitate its business operations. These tools are intended to assist employees with the execution of their job duties and must not be abused. Chipotle has adopted an Acceptable Use Policy to define activities that are permissible when using any Chipotle data, computer, and/or communications assets, and systems. All Chipotle employees share in the responsibility for ensuring that Chipotle information assets and resources receive an appropriate level of protection by ensuring compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy . Please refer to our Acceptable Use Policy and Information Security Policy for detailed guidelines on the use of Chipotle's information technology. Violation of the Acceptable Use Policy and Chipotle Information Security Policy will result in disciplinary action, including termination. MOBILE AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES Excessive use of personal mobile or electronic devices (\"mobile devices\") during the workday can interfere with employee productivity, impact food safety and be distracting to others. Employees are, therefore, prohibited from using mobile devices, headphones, and ear buds during working time and in food preparation or handling areas in our restaurants, except in the case of an emergency. Employees may not use a mobile device in a manner that violates our Policy Against Unlawful Harassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation, Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, or any other Chipotle policies. Chipotle will not be liable for the loss of personal mobile devices brought into the workplace. PERSONAL USE OF CHIPOTLE-PROVIDED HANDHELD DEVICES Chipotle may issue a Chipotle-owned handheld device to an employee for work-related communications. These devices should be used in accordance with this policy. Employees will be held responsible for any charges incurred for an employee's personal or unauthorized use of any Chipotle­ provided mobile devices. RECORDING DEVICES Employees are prohibited from photographing or making audio or video recordings of our guests outside of company-authorized surveillance platforms. Employees are further prohibited from saving, storing, sharing, or allowing access to surveillance video recordings for their own use or the use of non-employees.

This policy is not intended to conflict with or limit employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act. Chipotle monitors employees and their use of Chipotle Systems and Chipotle Data to meet our obligations under the law and our promises to our business partners, customers, and employees. We also monitor for purposes of ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory, or other requirements applicable to our business and employees in all countries where Chipotle operates.

The US Employee Privacy describes the categories of personal information that we collect, how we use your personal information, how we secure your personal information, when we may disclose your personal information to third parties, and our retention policies associated with your personal information. SOCIAL MEDIA We are dedicated to our Food With Integrity mission and take pride in our commitment to using only real ingredients in all of our recipes. One way to share our mission is through social media, influencers, and other online outlets. Chipotle's social media team is solely responsible for Chipotle's social media activity. You are not authorized to speak or write on Chipotle's behalf, but you may participate in Chipotle sponsored communications on platforms such as lnstagram or TikTok when requested and authorized by Chipotle's social media or communications team. Social media is also a quick way for you to connect with friends and share information and personal opinions. If you aren't careful and you don't think things through, your online activity can also damage Chipotle's brand or spread misleading or incomplete information about Chipotle. To avoid this, our Social Media Policy applies to all Chipotle employees. Chipotle will take all steps to stop unlawful and unethical acts (as defined in Chipotle's Code of Ethics) and behavior and may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against you if you violate this policy or any other Chipotle policy, including Chipotle's Code of Ethics , through the use of social media. Employees are not permitted to participate in social media using their Chipotle email address. You should use only your personal email address for your social media accounts. Please remember to protect yourself and your privacy on social media. What you publish online is easy to find and will exist for a long time. Think before posting. You alone are personally responsible for your online activity. Your social media activities (other than the requested and authorized use as described above) are outside the course and scope of your employment with Chipotle. This means that you may not use Chipotle's computers, telephones, or equipment for social media when you are on working time, except when requested and authorized by Chipotle's social media or communications team. You may not make any statements on social media about Chipotle's business or financial results in a manner that implies that it is based on insider or confidential information. You must keep confidential information (such as Chipotle's business results, financial condition, etc.) confidential consistent with the Code of Ethics and you may not share it online or anywhere else. This means that you may not post online pictures or videos of any non-public area of our restaurants such that recipes, confidential food preparation information or internal information regarding menu items, possible promotions, or other similar confidential and proprietary, business information is revealed. You may not make any statements about Chipotle, its employees, suppliers, customers, competition, or investors, that are obscene, slanderous, threatening, intimidating, or a violation of Chipotle's workplace policies against workplace violence, discrimination, harassment, or hostility on account of age, race, religion, sex, ethnicity, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, familial status, status as a domestic violence victim, veteran status, genetic information, reproductive health decision-making, or any other protected class, status, or characteristic. You also may not photograph or record video of customers, including athletes or other celebrities - doing so may subject you to invasion of privacy or other claims. This policy should not be interpreted as and will not be applied so as to restrict any activity that is protected under the National Labor Relations Act, such as the right to discuss wages, hours, and any other working conditions. Nor should this policy be interpreted as and will not be applied to whistleblower laws, or other applicable law. Social media account ownership: To the extent employees are authorized as part of their job duties to use social media account(s) to advance Chipotle's interests, Chipotle, not the employee, owns the account(s) and employees are required to return all logins and passwords for such accounts at the end of employment. MEDIA INQUIRIES We are committed to providing accurate and complete information to the public and to all government and regulatory agencies. To accomplish this, certain Chipotle employees are official spokespersons for the company. If you are not a designated Chipotle spokesperson, you may not speak on behalf of the company. If you receive a request from the media or a request for information from someone outside the company, be courteous, but don't respond. Instead, refer the request to Chipotle's External Communications Department at mediarelations@chipotle.com . If you receive a request from a government official or agency, be courteous but refer the request to the Legal Department. CHANGES IN EMPLOYEE RECORDS To keep your employee records up to date and to ensure that the appropriate benefits are available to you, you are expected to notify Chipotle promptly of any change of name, address, phone number, number of dependents, or other applicable information. OUTSIDE INQUIRIES CONCERNING EMPLOYEES All inquiries concerning employees from outside sources, including requests for references, should be directed to the \"The Work Number,\" a third-party vendor, by contacting theworknumber.com , using Chipotle's code (33171).

If an employee has authorized disclosure in writing, information on the amount of salary or wage last earned will be provided. NOTICE OF RESIGNATION In the event you choose to resign from your position, we ask that you provide at least two (2) weeks' written notice. You are responsible for returning Chipotle property in your possession or for which you are responsible. EXIT INTERVIEW In the event you choose to leave Chipotle, you may be asked to complete a Chipotle Exit Survey or attend an exit interview conducted by your manager or HR Business Partner if you are in the RSC, or the RWH Team if you are in a restaurant. The purpose of the survey or interview is to determine the reasons for your separation, resolve questions, or attend to other matters related to the separation. In our food, we use real ingredients and prepare them with classic cooking techniques. In our culture, we strive to find real people who create great teams, focused on delivering an excellent guest experience.

    "content": "Page 1: 1 Page 2: EXPECTATIONS AND COMMITMENT Congratulations on your selection to be a part of a New Restaurant Opening (NRO) at Chipotle. This is one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences a Chipotle employee can be a part of. You will play a pivotal role in ensuring that the management team and crew at this brand-new Chipotle makes the line the moment of truth from day one. This is a unique opportunity to establish a world-class training culture and ensure the new team learns how to teach and taste Chipotle. During the next several days, you will be expected to provide a thorough, engaging, and organized training experience for your new team. In order to do that, it is helpful to revisit the Certified Trainer Top 5, which every Chipotle manager should carry with them throughout their career: The Role of the Certified Trainer 1. Train new hires to deliver 100% of the standards 100% of the time 2. Cross-train your team to deliver 100% of the standards 100% of the time 3. Uphold Chipotle’s standards and procedures 4. Use the training materials to ensure consistency 5. Provide honest and timely feedback often and sincerely While you are training your team, which will be a mix of pre-trained and brand-new crew, it will be especially important to keep these in mind. Brand new crew will need a lot of direction and guidance with very thorough introductions. Others may have bad habits that we need to coach very closely. Some may just need to build their confidence, and the rest will blow you away by how quickly they become rock stars! No matter what, using our tools will ensure a consistent and clear message from you to your trainees, so they know exactly how to deliver the Chipotle standard. Here are some other tips to make sure you’re well-prepared: • Read through this guide to understand the structure of each day. Reach out to your NRO Strategist/Manager with any questions. • Have a deep knowledge of and prepare to fully utilize all training materials. Review the Trainer’s Guide in depth for any stations or tasks which you will be teaching. • Stay organized, disciplined, and keep your eye on the clock. • Be relentless in upholding the standard- demand perfection and settle for excellence. We commonly make the mistake of moving the target based on an employee’s abilities: the standard remains the standard regardless. • Be patient and be motivating. Guide them to the standard with clear and direct feedback, the perfect learning state is “relaxed alertness” – calm and engaged. • Avoid the word “I”. It’s not about how I like to cut an onion- it’s about how “we” cut onions at Chipotle. There’s only one best way – our way, the Chipotle way. COMMITMENT I commit to the above expectations and to fully apply my talents and effort to my team and everyone involved in the NRO process, to be the best trainer I can be, teach the “one best way” and aim for 100% of the standard, 100% of the time.

Greet the customer with ‘‘Hi, welcome to Chipotle!’’ or ‘‘hello!’’ then ask, ‘‘what can I get started for you?’’ 2. If a burrito is ordered, place a burrito-sized tortilla in the press. While the tortilla is heating, pull out a piece of burrito-sized foil and place it shiny side down on the line, smoothing out the corners with both hands, with the crease running parallel to the line 3. As soon as the press rises slightly and/or steam escapes (approximately 8 seconds), remove the tortilla and place it centered on the foil, the side with the toast points down on the foil a. Do not apply pressure to the press while heating the tortilla; this will result in a crispy tortilla b. Keep the edge of the tortilla and foil along the edges of the pans; this is called ‘‘riding the rail’’ c. Keep your non-dominant hand behind the tortilla; this is called the ‘‘backstop’’ d. While adding ingredients, ensure to not touch the utensils to the tortilla/other ingredients 4. Ask as many of the following questions as you can while the tortilla is heating up, repeating the requests back to the guest: 5. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any white or brown rice?’’ a. Place one rounded spoonful of the selected rice in the center of the tortilla 6. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any black or pinto beans?’’ a. Get a rounded spoonful of beans, tap the spoon twice to shake off excess broth, then place directly on top of the rice b. If fajitas are requested, place a pinch of fajitas on top of the other ingredients 7. Ask ‘‘What kind of meat would you like?’’ a. Place one full scoop or tong-full of the selected meat directly on top of the other ingredients 8. Ask ‘‘Would you like to add queso to your entrée or on the side?’’ a. If on the entrée, pull one ladle-full horizontally across the other ingredients and send a yellow table tent down the line in front of the entree b. If on the side, ask ‘‘Regular or large?’’ and fill the proper container per request 67 Page 68: 9. Ask, ‘‘What kind of salsa would you like?’’ a. If Mild or Medium Corn, get a rounded spoonful, tap the spoon twice to shake off excess liquid and place directly on top of the other ingredients b. If Medium Green or Hot, get a ladle full holding the ladle ‘‘like a pencil’’ and pull horizontally across the other ingredients c. If multiple salsas are requested, split the portions accordingly- a half scoop of each for 2 salsas, and so on 10. Ask, ‘‘Any sour cream or cheese?’ a. If sour cream, get a spoonful, tap the spoon twice to remove excess and ‘‘ribbon’’ horizontally across the other ingredients b. Pro-Tip: ‘‘air tap’’ the spoon to avoid dirtying the pan edge c. If cheese, sprinkle a three-finger pinch over the other ingredients 11. Ask, ‘‘Would you like to add guac?’’ a. If guac, tap the spoon twice and ‘‘double-phwap’’ the guacamole in a line behind the rest of the ingredients closest to you 12. Ask, ‘‘Did we make this perfectly for you?’’ a. If ‘‘Yes,’’ tightly roll the burrito, label properly and pass to the Expo/Cash 68 Page 69: ROLLING A BURRITO 1. Lift the side of the tortilla closest to you with your dominant hand while lifting the side closest to the guest with your non-dominant hand, forming a ‘‘giant taco’’. 2. Use your dominant hand to slide the tortilla over the food in the middle as you release your front hand, forming a wide, loose grip around the food. Do not squeeze, which will cause the burrito to tear on the ends. If done properly, you can release your hand and the burrito will stay in place. 3. Using your non-dominant hand, tuck your fingers under the tortilla, pinch with your thumb and fold up to make a two- or three-finger fold on the side of the burrito. 4. Holding your first fold in place, release your dominant hand and repeat the fold on the opposite end of the burrito. Leave a one- to two-inch gap between the two folds. Make the two folds point like an arrow toward your guest; this prevents ‘‘dog ears’’ on the end of the tortilla once the burrito is rolled. 5. Roll the burrito forward, tightening with one hand at a time, marching left hand then right hand. 6. Once the burrito is wrapped, place a thumb on the front of the foil and slide the burrito back, smoothing the foil and tightening the burrito. 7. Roll the burrito forward in the foil, wrapping until the tortilla is no longer visible. 8. Tuck the foil around each end of the burrito in a cupping motion. 9. Repeat the folds on each end just as you did with the tortilla. 10. Roll the burrito forward, tightening with one hand at a time. 11. Once complete, label the burrito and pass it to Expo. 69 Page 70: BOWL 1. Greet the customer with ‘‘Hi, welcome to Chipotle!’’ or ‘‘hello!’’ then ask, ‘‘what can I get started for you?’’ 2. If a bowl is ordered, ask ‘‘For here or to go?’’ a. If ‘‘for here’’, grab a bowl b. If ‘‘to go’’, grab a bowl and a lid, and place the lid underneath the bowl 3. We do not need to ‘‘ride the rail’’ with a bowl; instead, we can take the bowl directly to the ingredients requested. This is called ‘‘flying to the food’’ 4. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any white or brown rice?’’ a. Place one rounded spoonful of the selected rice in the center of the bowl 5. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any black or pinto beans?’’ a. Get a rounded spoonful of beans, tap the spoon twice to shake off excess broth, then place directly on top of the rice b. If fajitas are requested, place a pinch of fajitas on top of the other ingredients 6. Ask ‘‘What kind of meat would you like?’’ a. Place one full scoop or tong-full of the selected meat directly on top of the other ingredients 7. Ask ‘‘Would you like to add queso to your entrée or on the side?’’ a. If on the entrée, pull one ladle-full horizontally across the other ingredients and send a yellow table tent down the line in front of the entree b.

If sour cream, get a spoonful, tap the spoon twice to remove excess and ‘‘ribbon’’ horizontally across the other ingredients b. Pro-Tip: ‘‘air tap’’ the spoon to avoid dirtying the pan edge c. If cheese, sprinkle a three-finger pinch over the other ingredients 70 Page 71: 10. Ask, ‘‘Would you like to add guac?’’ a. Tap the spoon twice and ‘‘double-phwap’’ the guacamole in a line on top of the rest of the ingredients 11. Ask, ‘‘Did we make this perfectly for you?’’ a. If ‘‘Yes,’’ label properly according to the ‘‘How to Label Entrees’’ Recipe Card and pass to the Expo/Cash b. If to go, place the lid on top of the bowl and secure to the bowl base using a pinch all the way around the edge. Do not run your fingers along the edge as this does not create a secure seal. 71 Page 72: SALAD 1. Greet the customer with ‘‘Hi, welcome to Chipotle!’’ or ‘‘hello!’’ then ask, ‘‘what can I get started for you?’’ 2. If a salad is ordered, ask ‘‘For here or to go?’’ a.

Grab one Chipotle Honey Vinaigrette and bring it down the line in front of the salad a. We do not need to ‘‘ride the rail’’ with a salad; instead, we can take the salad directly to the ingredients requested. This is called ‘‘flying to the food’’ 5. Ask, ‘‘Would you like any black or pinto beans?’’ a. With salads, the lettuce is meant to replace the rice. If they would still like rice, remember to customize with a smile b. Get a rounded spoonful of beans, tap the spoon twice to shake off excess broth, then place directly on top of the lettuce c. If fajitas are requested, place a pinch of fajitas on top of the other ingredients 6. Ask ‘‘What kind of meat would you like?’’ a. Place one full scoop or tong-full of the selected meat directly on top of the other ingredients 7. Ask ‘‘Would you like to add queso to your entrée or on the side?’’ a.

    "content": "Page 1: ORIENTATION THE TRAINER’S GUIDE If you’re looking at this guide, it’s because you’re training someone. As a Certified Trainer, you’re training new hires or cross-training existing crew members. As a leader, you are training new leaders. This guide exists to help you teach any topic to your trainee so they can master their station or move LINE up in the Career Path. It will help you deliver the best training experience possible. Remember, training at Chipotle is not just reading a book or showing a video. Training at Chipotle is YOU getting in there with your trainee shoulder to shoulder, introducing them to everything they need to know, letting them shadow you while you teach, explaining best practices, giving them feedback as CASH they perform a task, and validating that they can do it on their own. I’m excited for you to be taking on this opportunity because you’ll be supporting one of your fellow crew members and learning too by refreshing yourself on our standards and building experience as a trainer. That’s why there’s much truth in the saying, “When you teach one person, two people learn.” DIGITAL This is the Trainer’s Guide. Its purpose: to help trainers teach any topic any crew member or leader would need to know to learn a new station or move up to the next level of the Career Path. Trainers can be Certified Trainers if we’re talking about training new hires or cross-training existing crew members, but they can also be leaders. After all, leaders have to train their replacement before moving to the next level. PREP This guide doesn’t work on its own. It has to be used with Training Checklists, which list the topics that a trainee needs to learn in order to be validated. For each topic in the Training Checklist, there’s a topic in the Trainer’s Guide. The trainer refers to the Trainer’s Guide to know exactly how to introduce the topic and then how to work with the trainee through shadow and perform. It also recommends specific validation questions that help the trainee prepare for their GRILL final knowledge check. To navigate the Trainer’s Guide, select the tab for the position you’re training. Then select the topic. You’ll see what your trainee will need to know and why it’s important when you introduce the topic, followed by shadowing and performing CERTIFIED instructions and some ways to validate knowledge. You can jump from topic to TRAINER topic by selecting the tabs on the left, and you can print out a page or certain activities if you need a paper copy for reference. The Trainer’s Guide was created based on best practices from restaurants across the company. It is updated regularly based on input from trainers like you. It is meant to be followed as it is written to provide the highest levels of food quality, KITCHEN food safety, and learning. Therefore, deviating from the methods in this guide LEADER can put the guest experience and trainee experience at risk. That being said, we appreciate feedback and your desire to improve upon our methods. If you believe there is a better way than the one best way described in this guide, share that with your Field Leader, who should contact your Regional SERVICE Training Manager to discuss.

APPRENTICE Page 31: ORIENTATION BUILDING ENTRÉES INTRODUCE WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW? • Proper portions create the perfect flavor profile. LINE • Proper stacking makes the food look great and spreads ingredients evenly over the entrée. • Crew Pocket Guide includes all portion sizes with the utensils used for portioning, as well as how to properly build each entrée for dine-in and CASH to-go. • Practice is the only way to perfect portioning; use a scale and an empty bowl. • Never hold down on the tortilla press—it will rise when the tortilla soufflés. • Entrées with extra meat are lead by a red tent. Entrées with queso blanco are led by a yellow tent. Entrées with an LTO are lead by a white tent. DIGITAL • Finish entrées differently for dine-in or to-go (except burritos). • Burritos are rolled tightly in a long cylinder. Burritos must never be softball-shaped, and the tortilla must not tear or break. BUILDING ENTRÉES COURSES PREP • Teach how to make perfectly portioned entrées that also look great. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? • Proper portions and stacking ensure guests get a little bit of every ingredient in each bite. • Using the right portions every time creates consistency for our guests. GRILL • Holding down on the tortilla press dries the tortilla out, making it less pliable and harder to roll. • Beautiful food makes for a better guest experience. • Finishing to-go entrées correctly ensures they don’t spill or leak.

This is the process of identifying any potential food safety risks in the restaurant, then coming up with a plan to prevent them. CCP stands for Critical Control Points. Based on the Hazard Analysis, a CCP is CASH created to control the hazards in the restaurant that present the biggest food safety risks, so it’s critical to monitor and control them to keep the restaurant safe. If there are any CCP failures, then corrective action(s) must be taken to ensure adulterated or contaminated product is never served to our guests. The FSL is the senior leader on duty at any given moment. As a KL, you may DIGITAL be scheduled as a FSL at opening. Because many of the critical control points (CCPs) live entirely within the back of house, your FSL may delegate much of the responsibility of filling out certain sections to you. You’ll need to be familiar with not just the CCPs within your BOH responsibilities, but also the corrective actions you’ll need to take in the PREP event of any CCP failures. These corrective actions are listed in the DHCL for your reference. WHY IT’S IMPORTANT: The Daily HACCP Control Log (DHCL) ensures that every restaurant has GRILL excellent food safety practices. Most of our food safety intervention and control points take place in the back of house. Proper food safety practices and procedures in the back of house are where we have the most control over the safety of the food we CERTIFIED are serving to our guests.

This is LINE done by tasting food critically for flavor & aroma and texture & mouth feel and by making sure the appearance and color of food follows standards. FACT is an acronym used to describe the 4 tasting quality standards for each food item: CASH  F stands for Flavor & Aroma  A stands for Appearance  C stands for Color  T stands for Texture & Mouth Feel DIGITAL The FACT standards for each food item can be found on the Recipe Card, since tasting is a step written into each recipe to make sure the food item meets our standards as it’s prepared. To ensure that all food looks and tastes delicious to every single guest throughout the entire day, food FACT tastings are also completed at 4 scheduled times throughout the PREP day. No food can go out without you checking it and tasting it. As the KL, you are the protector of our food! FREQUENCY GRILL The leader, ideally the KL since they’re responsible for our food, is responsible for ensuring food FACT tastings happen at the following times:  During prep: The team is responsible for tasting each food item as it’s prepared.  During service: The team is responsible for tasting each food item CERTIFIED before it goes to the line.

LEADER Having a water cup allows you to take a drink of water after you taste each item to reset your palate. SERVICE LEADER APPRENTICE Continued on the next page ¬ Page 225: ORIENTATION FOOD FACT TASTING CONTINUED FOOD FACT RESPONSE GUIDE For any food item that doesn’t meet a certain standard of FACT, you need to work with your team to fix it. The exact steps will vary depending on the food item and the standard missed. The Food FACT Response Guide, located LINE on the back of each Food FACT Tasting Sheet, is used for this. Sometimes adjustments can be made on the spot to improve the quality of the food so it can be served to guests. But sometimes the food has serious issues and no adjustments can be made to the food to bring it up CASH to a quality that can be served to our guests. If this is the case, the right thing to do for our guests is to replace, retrain and make it fresh. That’s why following the Food FACT Response Guide is so important. A few common examples include: DIGITAL • Reseason & Retrain: The standard for flavor & aroma for steak is fresh beef steak flavor with medium back palate heat from the adobo marinade and distinctive salt flavor. If you’re tasting steak and find that it doesn’t have a distinctive salt flavor, that means enough salt isn’t being added or it’s not being added at the right time. Work with your Grill team to make new steak, while you make sure that they’re salting the steak as soon as PREP they lay it on the grill and that they’re sprinkling the steak with a light, even layer of salt. • Remove & Report: The standard for texture & mouth feel for pinto beans is soft and tender. If you taste pinto beans that have a very hard texture, Remove & Report. Since these pinto beans cannot be served and you GRILL cannot fix the issue in the restaurant, remove them and complete a Food Quality Report. This is why we taste every batch before it hits the line. • Replace & Retrain: The standard for color for fajitas is mix of green and purple with evenly caramelized edges. The standard for texture & mouth feel is crisp with slight crunch, not raw, soggy, or limp. If you find the CERTIFIED fajitas Color is not to standard since you don’t see any caramelization TRAINER and when you taste the fajitas, they have a raw texture, you need to Replace & Retrain. Using the Recipe Card, cook the next batch shoulder- to-shoulder with the Grill team member. Coach and validate they are using the correct tools, cooking the right amount, and sprinkling the KITCHEN fajita mix evenly across the grill. When retraining, always use your tools LEADER and always retaste the final product to ensure the new bath has met all Food FACT standards. • Replace & Retrain: The standard for texture & mouth feel for brown rice is light, fluffy and tender, not sticky, chewy or crunchy. If you’re tasting SERVICE brown rice and find that it’s crunchy, that means it hasn’t been cooked LEADER long enough or it doesn’t have the correct amount of water. Work with your Grill team to make new rice, while you make sure that they’re cooking it for the proper amount of time, depending on the equipment used, and that they’re using the correct amount of water, depending on the elevation. APPRENTICE Continued on the next page ¬ Page 226: ORIENTATION FOOD FACT TASTING CONTINUED Whenever you discover an issue, figure out: • Is the food being prepared following the correct recipe to ensure the proper flavor & aroma and texture & mouth feel? LINE • Are the standards being followed to ensure the proper appearance and color? • Did the team member who prepared the food taste it? CASH • As the KLT, did I check and taste the food before it went to the line? • As the KLT, did I validate food throughout prep instead of just as it went to the line? • Was the correct quantity of food cooked for the sales volume and time DIGITAL of day? • Is the food within the SSL? WHY IT’S IMPORTANT • Food FACT tasting ensures every guest enjoys food that meets our standards, no matter which restaurant they visit or what time they visit. PREP • Evaluating the appearance and color ensures the food looks great for our guests. • Food FACT tasting is the only way to ensure proper flavor & aroma and texture & mouth feel. GRILL • Food FACT tasting is a critical culinary skill used to develop Chipotle’s recipes. Practicing tasting frequently allows us to appreciate the depth of flavor in Chipotle’s food and make better adjustments. • Chipotle sources fresh produce that comes from different locations CERTIFIED throughout the year. This may result in subtle changes in any part of TRAINER FACT. Tasting helps us detect these differences and make adjustments. For example, while tasting roasted corn-chili salsa, you may notice you need to add extra jalapeños to get the correct spice level.

APPRENTICE Page 228: ORIENTATION PREP SHEET INTRODUCE WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The Prep Sheet is a tool that calculates how much food you need to prepare LINE for the day. It calculates these amounts using the forecasted sales (anticipated sales that are projected for the day) and the usage per thousand (also known as UPT: how much of each item the restaurant goes through per $1000 in sales). In the upper left-hand section of the Prep Sheet are the projected sales for the day, followed by the sales projected for the AM shift (open – 3:00pm) and the CASH PM shift (3:00pm to close). Projected sales are one of the major factors that determine how much food to prepare. If the restaurant’s actual sales are much higher than the projected sales, you run the risk of running out of food. If the actual sales are lower than the projected sales, you run the risk of over prepping and wasting food. It is critical that we have every ingredient available for our DIGITAL guests at all times. The tool is divided into columns and rows. The columns are labeled Needs, On Hand, and AM or PM Prep. The needs are calculated automatically, and when combined with the units in the “Prep Unit” column, they tell us exactly how much prep we’ll need to get through the shift or day. For example, if the AM PREP Needs for medium corn salsa is 19.92, and the prep amount for medium corn salsa is 1/6 pans, we know we’ll need 19.92 1/6 pans of corn salsa to get through today. Next to the Needs column is an On Hand column, where we write how much of that prepared food item we have that can be served to guests. This is not GRILL calculated automatically. The Kitchen Leader must count the inventory and enter it here. Pay special attention to Secondary Shelf Lives (SSLs) and only count food that is not expired. Specifically, adhere to these guidelines: • Lettuce – ONLY hold overnight if the SSL is not expired, there is no CERTIFIED browning present. There should be a note on the previous day’s Prep Sheet TRAINER that lettuce was prepped on the PM shift. • Cut Limes – NEVER hold overnight. • Onions and Cilantro – NEVER hold overnight. Opening on-hand counts should be 0. Enter needs into PDT to find accurate quantity KITCHEN needed. Write those numbers in the PREP column. LEADER • Cheese – Shred in the AM as part of Focused Prep. There shouldn’t be more than 4 pans held overnight. If more than 4, note why. • Guacamole – NEVER hold overnight guacamole that was placed on the line for service. Guacamole can be held overnight if SSL is NOT expired, and it SERVICE was NOT placed on the line for service. LEADER • Mild Salsa – NEVER hold overnight. • Vinaigrette - While this item has an overnight hold, if it does not meet FACT standards, discard it. It is NEVER acceptable to alter or replace pan labels to extend SSLs. APPRENTICE Continued on the next page ¬ Page 229: ORIENTATION PREP SHEET CONTINUED LINE CASH DIGITAL Subtract the On Hand amount from the amount in the Needs column to calculate how much to prepare in the morning. For example, if this same restaurant had two 1/6 pans of corn leftover from the night before, the AM PREP prep for corn salsa is only 17.92 1/6 pans of corn because two pans are already finished. Always round up to the nearest number that makes sense. For instance, round 17.92 up to 18. _ RAW ITEM NEEDS ON HAND = TOTAL Medium Corn Salsa 19.92 2 17.92 GRILL For some items, it might make sense to round to the nearest decimal. For instance, for washed and rinsed lettuce, round 2.08 up to 2.25, not 3. Consider our recipes when determining PREP amounts. For example: • Corn Salsa – Prep in EVEN quantities (8, 10, 12, etc.). CERTIFIED TRAINER • Green Salsa, Hot Salsa, and Sour Cream – ONLY prep what is needed. Just because it’s easy to prepare doesn’t mean you should make more than the NEED. Note: if you receive the 20lb bags of Sour Cream, always prep the entire bag at a time (1 20lb bag = 5 deep 1/6 pans) KITCHEN • Washed/Blanched Jalapenos – Wash and blanch enough to dice LEADER tomorrow. If UPT isn’t high enough due to past under-prepping, wash and blanch one pound for every $1,000 in sales until UPT catches up. Example: sales tomorrow = $10,000, wash and blanch 10 pounds. • Steak – Can be prepped in increments of 2 (2,4,6,8, etc.). Steak should SERVICE be completely covered in adobo and laid flat in each pan, with no excess LEADER juice at the bottom of the pan liner. When counting, make sure a copy of the manufacturer’s label is included in the pan. • Chicken – Prep in increments of 4 (a full case). Round up or down to match a full case (4, 8, 12, 16, etc.). When counting, make sure a copy of APPRENTICE the manufacturer’s label is included in the pan.

Look at the PM NEEDS to determine amount to prep for TOMORROW. This amount goes in the AM NEEDS column and should PREP be prepped by 11:00am. In the PM, ON HAND should be the same as the AM NEEDS and prep amount should be ZERO. GRILL CERTIFIED TRAINER KITCHEN LEADER To ensure there is the right amount of food prepped for each shift, the Kitchen Leader must count the prep sheet twice per day. The AM On Hand SERVICE count must be completed prior to the start of morning prep. The PM On LEADER Hand count must be completed at 3:00pm. Along with completing the PM On Hand count at 3:00pm, work with your leader to validate the actual sales for the AM shift were within 6% of the projections. Write the actual sales above the AM Sales box, along with time and your initials. APPRENTICE Continued on the next page ¬ Page 231: ORIENTATION PREP SHEET CONTINUED The 3:00pm process of comparing the AM forecast sales to actual sales, as well as completing the On Hand count for the PM shift is called a “Gut Check”. This tells us if we’re on track for the day or if we have to adjust our LINE plan. If actual sales are much higher or lower than forecasted, work with your leader to reproject, and reprint the prep sheet to ensure every guest who comes in for dinner can get exactly what they want. Once the AM forecasted sales have been validated and the PM On Hand count has been completed, subtract the On Hand amount from the amount in the Needs column to CASH calculate any items that need to be prepared for the PM shift. The closing leader will write the actual sales, time, and their initials above the FORECAST SALES at the end of the day. They will also check the walk-in and reach-ins to discard or donate any items that will expire before we open for business the next day.

H AM 100% Morning Prep for tomorrow (100% Today/100% Tomorrow): The food items to prep during the morning to set the next day up for success. The AM NEEDS column is 100% of your needs for the day. Every morning, you should be walking into the amount in the AM Needs column PREP already being on hand, because those items were prepped as the last part of Focused Prep from the day prior. Once you validate that you have the correct amount on hand, you’ll use the amount in the PM Needs column to determine how much you need to prep for the morning. The amount in the PM Needs is what should be prepped by 11:30am. For instance, if the AM Needs for Blocked Cheese is 1.97 Cases, but you only have 1 Case On Hand, GRILL you’ll need to Prep 1 Case to get you through today, plus the amount listed in the PM Needs column. For the PM Needs, during your 3:00PM Gut Check, validate that you have everything prepped that you’ll need for the next day.

SERVICE LEADER APPRENTICE Page 239: ORIENTATION COOKING TO NEEDS TOOL INTRODUCE WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: Cooking to Needs simply means cooking the right amount of food for LINE each part of the day. The Cooking to Needs Tool can help achieve this by comparing hourly sales trend data to the usage of each hot food item. Using this information, the tool then calculates how much food Grill should cook for a specific period of the day (broken down by hour). CASH You can access the Cooking to Needs Tool on Chiplinks. Within the Cooking to Needs Tool are two separate tabs - one for the AM Shift and one for the PM shift. Within each of these tabs, each hour’s sales projection is shown along with the quantity of each hot food item that should be cooked for that hour. Catering orders will also be incorporated by adding in the hot food quantities for each order into the corresponding hour. These figures DIGITAL are estimates, and there can be some variation if the actual sales are different from the projected sales. During any given time interval, the KL and Grill team use the Tool to plan and prepare for the shift by making sure the needs for each food item are fulfilled before the corresponding time interval begins. In other words, PREP when a given time interval begins, the grill team should have all of the food items listed under that time interval cooked. These food items can be on the front line, digital make line, or in the hotbox. Thus, the team has to work backwards to determine when to start cooking. For example, if the Cooking to Needs Tool told us we needed one deep 1/3 pan of chicken at 2PM and GRILL chicken takes 20 minutes to cook and cut, we’d start cooking the chicken at 1:40PM to make sure we have enough for the guests we are expecting to come in during the hour starting at 2PM. If you do not cook the recommended amount of food on time, your restaurant will likely run out of that item if the sales for that hour meet or exceed the predicted sales for CERTIFIED that hour. On the other hand, if too much food is cooked, it will likely carry TRAINER over into the next hour, which means it won’t look or taste as fresh and will lead to food waste later in the day.

DIGITAL PREP GRILL CERTIFIED TRAINER KITCHEN LEADER SERVICE LEADER APPRENTICE Page 242: ORIENTATION FOOD WITH INTEGRITY INTRODUCE WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: Food With Integrity (FWI) is Chipotle’s commitment to finding the very LINE best ingredients raised with respect for the animals, the environment, and the farmers. Chipotle is the only national restaurant brand that prepares food without added flavors, colors, or preservatives. All of the wholesome food served at CASH Chipotle is made from a short list of 53 real ingredients. Here are some important terms used to describe our food: WHY IT’S IMPORTANT: DIGITAL • Responsibly Raised meats: Chipotle believes animals should be Responsibly Raised. This means that they’re treated humanely and with respect from birth to slaughter, fed a vegetarian diet, and never given hormones or antibiotics. Chipotle buys more Responsibly Raised meat than any other restaurant in the United States. • rBGH: rBGH stands for Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone. It’s a synthetic PREP growth hormone that causes dairy cattle to produce more milk, but it can also cause joint problems and udder infections. We never want animals to be in pain, which is why 100% of the milk in our sour cream, cheese, and queso blanco comes from cows that have never been treated with rBGH . • Pasture Raised: Chipotle also believes dairy cows should be pasture GRILL raised. This means they’re given daily access to outdoor pastures, never given added hormones, and are fed an all-vegetarian diet. 100% of our sour cream and a large percentage of our cheese comes from pasture raised dairy cows. We’re working hard to increase the percentage of our pasture raised cheese. CERTIFIED TRAINER • Organic: We believe produce should be grown organically. Organic means grown without the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or weed killers. This is better for the produce and the long-term health of the soil. A good percentage of our beans are organically grown. Our goal is 100%, but it will take some time due to limited supply. KITCHEN LEADER • Local: We believe the less distance food has to travel, the better. Sourcing local food reduces food miles, supports rural economies, and ensures fresh, great-tasting seasonal produce. Local means within 350 miles from our restaurants. The amount and type of food bought locally depends on the growing season. We serve millions of pounds of locally grown produce SERVICE and are the only national restaurant committed to buying local on a LEADER significant scale. • Farmers: We respect the farmers who raise their animals and crops naturally with respect for the long-term health of the land and community. We support those farmers by buying from them instead of APPRENTICE larger farms and food distributors. Continued on the next page ¬ Page 243: ORIENTATION FOOD WITH INTEGRITY CONTINUED • People: We believe it’s important for people to know where their food comes from. We continually look for the best ingredients from the best sources. We give guests higher-quality food that tastes better and keeps them coming back. LINE • GMOs: GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism, which is a plant or animal created by inserting genes from one species (typically bacteria or a virus) into the DNA of another to achieve characteristics that would not occur naturally. In 2015, Chipotle became the first national restaurant company to cook only with non-GMO ingredients. While all of the ingredients CASH in our food are non-GMO, some of the beverages served contain GMOs [Watch the “Where Our Food Comes From” course on the Spice Hub] WHY IT’S IMPORTANT: DIGITAL Food With Integrity and Real Ingredients are what set us apart from the competition. Our commitment to sourcing responsibly and creating simple, wholesome food is a big reason many of our guests choose to eat at our restaurants. Understanding the quality of our food helps us appreciate its value. It PREP explains why we invest so much money purchasing it and why we take the time to inspect it when it arrives.

When you observe something that is not up to our standards, mention it right away. If you do not, you may forget to mention it entirely. You may also find it harder to bring it up later because it may seem irrelevant or useless now that the moment has passed. You also risk setting a newer, PREP lower standards for the team. Do it often - Giving useful feedback is a habit, and like any habit, you must practice it.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT KITCHEN When your team does not receive feedback, they are unaware of how they LEADER are performing against the standard. If you observe a team member doing something incorrectly and you do not say something, you are silently approving a newer, lower standard. SERVICE SHADOW LEADER The trainer will demonstrate giving feedback to the trainee. The trainer and trainee will go to a handwashing sink together.

When you lead the shift, you want to create an excellent experience for each LINE guest. In order to do that, you must be able to answer “yes” to the following three questions: 1. Do I have accurate sales projections? 2. Do I have the right amount of food? CASH 3. Do I have the right number of people? Sales projections—predictions for the total revenue you will generate based on historical trends, weather, and local events—are the single factor that DIGITAL determines how much food you need and how many people you need to run a great shift. So when you are evaluating your sales projections, take time to make sure that they are thoughtful by doing the following: PREP • Consider the weather, school schedule, or local events that will impact restaurant business. • Check Aloha Takeout, Catering Order Manager, and Dear Diary for large orders that will affect your projections for the day. GRILL Find your projected sales on the prep sheet and on the schedule. Check that the projected sales on the prep sheet match the projected sales on the schedule. CERTIFIED TRAINER KITCHEN LEADER SERVICE LEADER APPRENTICE Continued on the next page ¬ Page 302: ORIENTATION LEADING THE SHIFT CONTINUED LINE CASH DIGITAL PREP After you check your sales projections, making any necessary adjustments to the prep sheet and schedule, ask yourself if you will have enough food and if you will have enough labor to provide an excellent guest experience. GRILL Having the right amount of food: • Check with the Kitchen Leader to make sure the team is prepping enough food for the shift. • If you do not have enough food in the restaurant, call your GM/R/CTM or CERTIFIED Field Leader or call the closest restaurant for help. TRAINER • If your sales projections are accurate and you are still prepping too much or not enough food, tell your AP or GM/R/CTM and figure out why. KITCHEN Having the right number of people: LEADER • The schedule can tell you how many people you have scheduled compared to how many people are recommended. At the bottom of the schedule Peak Lunch or Peak Dinner (sch/rec) means scheduled / recommended. In the previous schedule, you’ll see 7/8 highlighted in SERVICE orange, which means this restaurant is understaffed for the shift. LEADER • If you don’t have enough people scheduled, try to call someone in to help. If you can’t find someone, call your Field Leader and ask for assistance. They may be able to find someone from another restaurant to help. APPRENTICE Continued on the next page ¬ Page 303: ORIENTATION LEADING THE SHIFT CONTINUED ADJUSTING LABOR BASED ON CHANGING SALES PROJECTIONS: A good guideline to follow is every $100 in sales equals one hour of labor. Here are some examples that show you how to use this: LINE • If you projected your sales to be $4,000, and you had a last minute catering order for $500, your new sales projection would be $4,500. That equals five hours of labor for the day, which means you could call in someone to work for five hours to help out. CASH • If you projected your sales to be $4,000 and, as the day continues, you notice it is slow, your new sales projection could be $3,500. That equals five hours of labor for the day, which means you would want to ask some people to go home early so you could save on labor. DIGITAL 1. Functions Screen 2. Manager Functions PREP GRILL 3.

Accurate sales projections and having the right amount of food and labor are the foundation to having an excellent guest experience and setting up your team for a successful shift. CASH If your sales projection is high, you’ll have leftover food on the line and in the walk-in and extra crew members standing around with little to do, costing the business money. If your sales projection is low, you’ll run out of food, slow down throughput, overwork your crew, and have a dirty restaurant with a poor guest experience.

A major expectation of the Apprentice is to schedule your team LINE appropriately. That means writing the schedule for the week. The number of people you schedule is based on the sales you project. If you think you’ll have higher sales, you’ll schedule more people. If you think you’ll have lower sales, you’ll schedule fewer people. Sales projections are CASH covered in detail in the next week of training. After completing the ChipForce training, you’ll evaluate the execution of previous schedules using the Labor – Schedule Check report, then start writing your own with your trainer. DIGITAL WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? A great schedule is the foundation for success in the coming week. It’s a plan that will help organize your team and set you up to have the right amount of people to execute every day. Writing a schedule forces you to think about everything coming up in the PREP week ahead, including weather, special events, fundraisers, promo days, and catering orders. The exercise of schedule writing keeps you one step ahead and helps you lead the team because you know what to expect and you have a plan. It’s important to use the Labor – Schedule Check because it can show you GRILL what opportunities you have to improve in your scheduling and planning for the week ahead. For example if you find you are exceeding the number of hours allotted to you by the Labor Matrix, you could think about scheduling differently to more accurately achieve your recommended Labor Matrix hours.

All Five DIGITAL Pillars are on the Deployment Tool. Here is how you can check to see if the Deployment Tool has been set up for Five Pillars execution and great throughput: ACES in PLACES is determined by the putting the best person for each position that is needed based on the projected sales. Also, the tool has all of PREP the correct positions on the Deployment Tool which is based on the number of people needed. Finally, the Deployment Tool lets the team know when they need to be deployed for the peak period so that we have everyone deployed for an excellent guest experience. One of the biggest pieces of MISE EN PLACE is all of the prep that is done GRILL in the morning. The Deployment Tool outlines who will be doing what prep and when that prep needs to be done, which sets us up to deliver an excellent guest experience. You can evaluate that the LINEBACKER is the right person. For all CERTIFIED deployments with 8 people or more the Linebacker is in RED. This means TRAINER that the leader on duty should be deployed to Linebacker during the peak period. Finally, you can evaluate the EXPO. For deployments with 5-7 people the expo is in RED. This means that the leader on duty should be deployed to KITCHEN expo during the peak period. LEADER WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? At the Apprentice level, you may not always complete the Deployment Tool, especially if your SL opens the restaurant for you and you come in on a SERVICE mid-shift, so it’s helpful to know how to review the Deployment Tool.

LEADER APPRENTICE Page 363: ORIENTATION BUILDING SALES INTRODUCE WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW? The best thing you can do to build sales is consistently provide an excellent LINE guest experience. If you start with that, you can accelerate building sales by doing the following: 1. Valuing your guests: When you value your guests, you build trust, loyalty, and connection and you get them to come more frequently. CASH 2. Partnering with your guests: When you partner with your guests, you reach out to new people in your neighborhood and you get them to discover your restaurant. DIGITAL PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT GUEST EXPERIENCE (FOOD, FEEL, FLOW) PREP GUESTS BRING IN THEIR FRIENDS GUESTS WILL COME BACK GRILL PARTNER WITH GUESTS USING: VALUE GUESTS WITH: • FUNDRAISERS • MANAGER COMPS • PROMO DAYS • SURPRISE AND DELIGHT • 45-DAY BOGOS • DOING THE RIGHT THING CERTIFIED TRAINER GUESTS COME MORE OFTEN Learn more by watching the Building Your Sales Course on the Spice Hub KITCHEN LEADER VALUING YOUR GUESTS You can show your guests that you value them by: • Showing appreciation: Tell them directly by saying thank you SERVICE LEADER • Give our guests something we know they will love — FREE FOOD: Most of our guests are not expecting this from us, so when we give it to them, it comes to them as a special and memorable surprise. It has the power to make an occasional guest a life-long regular. APPRENTICE Continued on the next page ¬ Page 364: ORIENTATION BUILDING SALES CONTINUED USING MANAGER COMP You are not the only person who can use a manager comp to wow a guest by giving away food for free. Your cashiers can do it too. They can run a LINE manager comp without a leader swipe, but they will need you to sign off on the receipt. But first, make sure that you have a conversation with them to explain how to do it, why we do it, and why it’s important. A few tips for making the most of your manager comp include: CASH • Use it for first-time guests. It makes quite a first impression. • Use it for loyal guests. It shows that you recognize and appreciate their business. • Tell them why you are giving them something for free. If you don’t, the guest could be confused or expect something for free every visit. DIGITAL • Use it to make an excellent experience even more excellent. • Keep manager comps under control. Do not exceed your budget. • Do not use manager comp to give free food to friends and family. Chances are they know about us already and love it as much as you do. PREP PARTNERING WITH YOUR GUESTS We have very effective marketing tools that give you an opportunity to reach out and build strong relationships with your community to grow your sales. This may include offering a fundraiser for a local school, or treating team GRILL members at a nearby hospital to buy-one-get-one (BOGO) burritos for a day. But don’t forget, no amount of sales building can ever replace a bad guest experience. You need to have excellent food, flow, and feel in your restaurant in order to create an excellent guest experience. If you do not, CERTIFIED TRAINER your guests will not want to come back. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? Building sales helps us grow Chipotle to open new restaurants that provide more opportunities for our people.
